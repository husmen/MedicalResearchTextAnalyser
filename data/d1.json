Studies using nonimaging features or incorporating non-DL methods for feature extraction or classification were excluded. Two reviewers independently evaluated studies for inclusion, and any discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Internal and external performance measures and pertinent study characteristics were extracted, and relationships among these data were examined using nonparametric statistics.Eighty-three studies reporting 86 algorithms were included. The vast majority (70 of 86, 81%) reported at least some decrease in external performance compared with internal performance, with nearly half (42 of 86, 49%) reporting at least a modest decrease (\u22650.05 on the unit scale) and nearly a quarter (21 of 86, 24%) reporting a substantial decrease (\u22650.10 on the unit scale). No study characteristics were found to be associated with the difference between internal and external performance.Among published external validation studies of DL algorithms for image-based radiologic diagnosis, the vast majority demonstrated diminished algorithm performance on the external dataset, with some reporting a substantial performance decrease.Keywords: Meta-Analysis, Computer

Characteristic radiographic findings are observed when serial films are obtained. The disease occurs most often in infants delivered by cesarean section, in prematures, and in infants of diabetic mothers. A new finding of hypoproteinemia was consistent in this series.Article HistoryAccepted: Aug 1970Published in print: Jan 1971 FiguresReferencesRelatedDetailsCited ByRespiratory Morbidity in Late Preterm and Term Babies Born by Elective Caesarean SectionAsaAhimbisibwe, KevinCoughlin, GenevieveEastabrook2019 | Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada, Vol. 41, No. 8Radiology IllustratedYoung HunChoi, In-OneKim2014Medical RadiologyEric J.Crotty2013Polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme gene and angiotensin-converting enzyme activity in transient tachypnea of neonate and respiratory distress syndromeMehmetSatar, ErdalTa\u015fk\u0131n, Ferda\u00d6zl\u00fc, AbdullahTuli, Kenan\u00d6zcan, Hacer Y.Y\u0131ld\u0131zda\u015f2012 | The Journal of Maternal-Fetal & Neonatal Medicine, Vol. 25, No. 9Correlation between transient tachypnea of the newborn and wheezing attackMustafa\u00c7akan, Bur\u00e7inNalbanto\u011flu, Ay\u015finNalbanto\u011flu, U\u011furDem\u0131rsoy, AysuSay2011 | Pediatrics International, Vol. 53, No. 6Early left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in premature infants born to preeclamptic mothersMerih\u00c7etinkaya, \u00d6zlemBostan, Nilg\u00fcnK\u00f6ksal, EvrenSemizel, Hilal\u00d6zkan, Seher\u00c7ak\u0131r2011 | Journal of Perinatal Medicine, Vol. 39, No. 1Predictable risk factors and clinical courses for prolonged transient tachypnea of the newbornJi YoungChang, Chang RyulKim, Ellen AKim, Ki SooKim2010 | Korean Journal of Pediatrics, Vol. 53, No. 3Medical RadiologyVeronicaDonoghue2008Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN): A role for polymorphisms in the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (ADRB) encoding genes?EceAslan, ErolTutdibi, SwantjeMartens, YihuaHan, DominikMonz, LudwigGortner2008 | Acta Paediatrica, Vol. 97, No. 10Taybi and Lachman's Radiology of Syndromes, Metabolic Disorders and Skeletal DysplasiasRalph S.Lachman2007The \u2018Double Lung Point\u2019: An Ultrasound Sign Diagnostic of Transient Tachypnea of the NewbornRobertoCopetti, LuigiCattarossi2007 | Neonatology, Vol. 91, No. 3Respiratory distress in neonatesArunKumar, V.Bhatnagar2005 | The Indian Journal of Pediatrics, Vol. 72, No. 5Is transient tachypnoea of the newborn associated with polymorphisms in the epithelial sodium channel encoding gene?

Methods A focus group was formed consisting of 11 radiology professionals from eight countries. Eight topics were submitted for discussion. The meeting was videotaped, transcribed, and analyzed according to the principles of qualitative healthcare research. Results Perceived advantages of SR were facilitation of research, easy comparison, discouragement of ambiguous reports, embedded links to images, highlighting important findings, not having to dictate text nobody will read, and automatic translation of teleradiology reports. Being compelled to report within a rigid frame was judged unacceptable. Personal convictions appeared to have high emotional value. It was felt that other healthcare stakeholders would impose SR without regard to what radiologists thought of it. If the industry were to provide ready-made templates for selected examinations, most radiologists would use them. Conclusion If radiologists can be convinced of the advantages of SR and the risks associated with failing to participate actively in its implementation, they will take a positive stand. The industry should propose technology allowing SR without compromising accuracy, completeness, workflows, and cost-benefit balance.

In evaluating the recipient with graft dysfunction, clinicians can choose among several imaging modalities, including ultrasonography, nuclear medicine studies, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. This review discusses the evaluation of the kidney transplant recipient using these imaging procedures, emphasizing the clinical diagnostic utility and role of each modality. A kidney biopsy is often required as a gold standard for diagnostic purposes. However, because of the inherent risks of a kidney biopsy, noninvasive imaging in diagnosing causes of graft dysfunction is a highly desired tool used and needed by the transplant community. Because the diagnostic accuracy varies depending on the time course and nature of the transplant-related complication, this review also addresses the advantages and limitations of each modality. The recent advances in kidney transplant imaging techniques and their clinical implications are also discussed."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2064288407", "relevance_score": 349.33813, "publication_year": 2009, "title": "Radiologic markers of osteoarthritis progression", "cited_by_count": 53, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Osteoarthritis", "level": 3, "score": 0.946551}, {"display_name": "Radiography", "level": 2, "score": 0.6249907}, {"display_name": "Compartment (ship)", "level": 2, "score": 0.6248405}, {"display_name": "Cartilage", "level": 2, "score": 0.5781635}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.39749753}, {"display_name": "Pathology", "level": 1, "score": 0.22873157}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Purpose": [0], "of": [1, 17, 56, 85, 87], "review": [2, 4, 80], "To": [3], "radiographic": [5, 36], "and": [6, 90, 96], "MRI": [7], "developments": [8], "in": [9, 13, 29, 44, 46, 63], "measuring": [10, 25], "osteoarthritis": [11, 75, 88], "progression": [12, 89], "the": [14, 18, 30, 60, 82], "tibiofemoral": [15, 32, 45], "compartment": [16], "knee.": [19], "Recent": [20], "findings": [21], "Standardized": [22], "techniques": [23], "for": [24, 41], "joint": [26], "space": [27], "width": [28], "medial": [31], "compartment,": [33], "using": [34], "standardized": [35], "protocols,": [37], "have": [38], "become": [39], "accepted": [40], "quantifying": [42], "changes": [43], "knee": [47], "osteoarthritis.": [48], "In": [49], "addition,": [50], "there": [51], "is": [52], "a": [53], "significant": [54], "body": [55], "supporting": [57], "data": [58], "on": [59], "longitudinal": [61], "change": [62], "MRI-derived": [64], "cartilage": [65], "morphology": [66], "(thickness,": [67], "volume)": [68], "as": [69], "an": [70], "end": [71], "point": [72], "to": [73], "reflect": [74], "progression/cartilage": [76], "loss.": [77], "Summary": [78], "This": [79], "appraises": [81], "current": [83], "methods": [84], "measurement": [86], "limitations": [91], "with": [92], "regards": [93], "their": [94], "interpretation": [95], "further": [97], "development.": [98]}, "authors": ["David J.

The study included 866 patients with radiographic scores at baseline and at 3 years, of whom 279 (32%) had erosive damage at baseline, and 609 (70%) by 3 years. Baseline and first-year values for Larsen erosion score, rheumatoid factor (RF), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), hemoglobin, nodules, swollen joint count, grip strength, duration of symptoms, and presence of RA-associated shared epitope were all risk factors for 3 year radiological outcome. In the non-erosive group at baseline (68%), high RF and ESR correctly predicted erosions or not by 3 years in 67%. Severity of erosions was correctly predicted by Larsen and swollen joint scores at baseline (82% correct), and Larsen score and ESR at one year (90% correct). In conclusion, most patients had evidence of radiological erosions by 3 years, despite early treatment with conventional drug therapy.

Imaging of the joint is an important element in the diagnostic work-up. Trauma and inflammatory arthritis account for most of the other TMJ problems. A thorough understanding of joint anatomy and normal function is a prerequisite for perceiving abnormalities and making the correct diagnosis.

Thirty faculty members were ranked according to their report turnaround time before and after implementation of voice recognition and according to their percentage reduction in report turnaround time. The report turnaround times before and after implementation of voice recognition for faculty were compared with the number of verified reports and work habit type.The average report turnaround time for the department before implementation of voice recognition was 28 hours. After implementation of voice recognition, the average turnaround time was 12.7 hours, and the volume of verified reports increased 5% between the two study periods. The improvement in report turnaround time for individual faculty members ranged from -33% to +93%, and the rank order did not change significantly (Spearman coefficient, 0.58; p < 0.05). Faculty members' ranks in report turnaround time did not correlate significantly with volume rank before and after implementation of voice recognition (Spearman coefficients, 0.341 and 0.346; p > 0.05). Faculty members who had type 1 work habits, that is, reviewed, revised, and finalized reports at the time of image review, benefited the most from use of voice recognition.Use of voice recognition software decreased report turnaround time for the department and for 28 of 30 individual faculty members.

[4461]}, "authors": ["David P. Winchester", "Eric A. Strom"], "abstract": "Standards of care in the diagnosis and management of any disease should be based on the best available scientific information. Such information is derived from prospective, randomized clinical trials through the cooperative group or intergroup mechanism, single or multi-institutional prospective trials, prospective nonrandomized trials, retrospective studies, and personal experience. A collaborative effort of the American College of Radiology, the American College of Surgeons, the College of American Pathologists, and the Society of Surgical Oncology in 1992 culminated in a publication entitled \u201cStandards for Breast-Conservation Treatment.\u201d1 Both invasive and noninvasive diseases were considered in that document, although the focus was on invasive breast cancer. A task force of the same four national organizations decided that a sufficient body of knowledge had developed about ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast for a separate standard to be published. Before the widespread use of screening mammography, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) was an infrequently encountered problem that was routinely treated by mastectomy. As a result, a limited amount of information exists about the natural history of DCIS to act as a basis for treatment decisions. In addition, most DCIS seen today is identified mammographically because of the presence of microcalcifications, and it is unclear whether the biologic potential of this subclinical DCIS is the same as that of clinically evident DCIS. Total mastectomy, excision and irradiation, and excision alone all have been advocated as management strategies for DCIS. The acceptance of breast-conserving therapy for invasive carcinoma has stimulated great interest in the use of this technique for the management of DCIS. However, data from randomized trials comparing mastectomy with lumpectomy and irradiation in patients with invasive carcinoma cannot be directly extrapolated to patients with DCIS. In the patient with invasive carcinoma, the risk of metastatic disease is present at the time of diagnosis and is not altered by local recurrence in the breast. In DCIS, the risk of metastases at the time of diagnosis is negligible, so an invasive local recurrence carries with it the risk of increased breast cancer mortality. The appropriateness of breast-conserving approaches in DCIS should be determined by the incidence of invasive recurrence in the breast and the results of salvage therapy. The evaluation of the results of different local therapies in DCIS is complicated by changes in the presentation of DCIS, differences in the extent of mammographic and pathologic evaluation over time, and the long natural history of the disease. Treatment selection for the individual patient with DCIS requires a clinical, mammographic, and pathologic evaluation. The term \u201cductal carcinoma in situ\u201d encompasses a heterogeneous group of lesions. Before a patient's suitability for breast conservation with or without irradiation or the necessity of mastectomy can be determined, the extent and character of the patient's disease must be identified by a thorough evaluation. An adequate history and physical examination include a complete assessment of the patient's overall health status. Much of the information needed to determine a patient's suitability for breast-conservation therapy can be obtained from a directed history and physical examination. The elements of the history and physical examination specific for breast cancer, which are listed in Table 1 of this article and Table 8 of \u201cStandards for Diagnosis and Management of Invasive Breast Carcinoma\u201d (page 90), represent information that may influence the selection of local therapy. DCIS most commonly presents mammographically as microcalcifications. How-ever, about 10% of mammographically evident DCIS is an uncalcified mass. Occasionally, DCIS is diagnosed without mammographic findings. Recent mammographic evaluation (usually within 3 months) before biopsy or definitive surgery is needed to establish the appropriateness of breast-conservation treatment by defining the extent of the patient's disease. Because the contralateral breast should be evaluated, bilateral mammography is required. Preoperatively, the diagnosis of DCIS can be suggested by mammography, but a definitive diagnosis depends on pathologic evaluation of the specimen. Because imaging techniques cannot determine whether the basement membrane has been violated, mammography cannot determine whether a tumor is invasive. Additionally, because peritumoral inflammation or fibrosis (or both) can cause a mass to be present along with microcalcifications, the diagnosis of DCIS requires histopathologic examination. The subtypes of DCIS can be suggested on the basis of characteristic patterns of calcifications, but these patterns are not diagnostic; the definitive diagnosis depends on the analysis of tissue by the pathologist. The mammogram may underestimate the extent of DCIS. This may be true with increasing lesion size. However, in all cases an effort should be made to determine the extent of tumoral calcifications preoperatively. In addition to routine mediolateral oblique and craniocaudal views, magnification views and any other special views that may be required should be obtained in an attempt to identify areas of calcified tumor that otherwise might not be apparent. The entire breast should be carefully examined to determine if areas of tumor are present elsewhere in it, which would influence a decision about breast-conserving treatment. The role of other imaging modalities, especially magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, in staging the extent of tumor within the breast has yet to be established. When breast-conservation treatment is appropriate, the goals of any surgical procedure on the breast are total removal of the tissue suspected or known to be malignant and minimal cosmetic deformity. These goals apply to both diagnostic biopsy and definitive local excision. Failure to consider them at all stages may jeopardize conservation of the breast. DCIS can present as a palpable mass, but this presentation is unusual. The standards described for palpable invasive disease apply to palpable DCIS. Because DCIS most commonly presents as microcalcifications, image-directed procedures are necessary for diagnosis and treatment. Stereotactic core-needle biopsy of the breast\u2014 performed by qualified radiologists, surgeons, or other physicians\u2014can be the initial approach for sampling suspicious nonpalpable mammographic abnormalities. Ultrasound-guided biopsy is useful for nonpalpable masses but usually cannot be relied upon for biopsy of microcalcifications. Not all patients with microcalcifications are ideal candidates for stereotactic biopsy. Some patients' breasts may be too small to be accommodated by the stereotactic system. The thickness of the breast must be adequate to allow the full throw of the automated biopsy device when such a device is used. Abnormalities just under the skin may pose technical problems in some cases. If calcifications are widely separated, generating useful stereotactic coordinates to guide needle biopsy may be difficult. When microcalcifications are not tightly clustered or when the sensitivity or resolution of the stereotactic imaging system is hampered so that individual microcalcifications are not well visualized, accurate localization and retrieval of microcalcifications within core biopsy specimens may be difficult. Finally, the difficulty of the procedure increases with an uncooperative patient. If any one or a combination of these adverse factors exists, image-directed open surgical biopsy is the preferred approach. For lesions amenable to stereotactic breast biopsy, multiple cores should be obtained, and the specimen should be radiographed to confirm an adequate sampling of the microcalcifications. Leaving some microcalcifications at the site is desirable because if DCIS is diagnosed, they can accurately image-direct the surgeon to definitive excision. If all microcalcifications or the entire mass has been removed, a marker can be left at the biopsy site so that the area can be localized. If a presurgical diagnosis of DCIS is made by percutaneous core-needle biopsy, physicians should be aware that areas of invasive carcinoma are found in about 20% of cases at the time of surgical excision. Nonpalpable, mammographically evident lesions that are excised surgically should be localized presurgically with a guide, such as a guide wire. Any suspicious lesion detected by mammography requires presurgical localization to ensure accurate removal of the abnormal area and to avoid excess sacrifice of breast tissue. The localization method can be needle-hook wire, dye injection, or a combination of both. Localization should be precise and may require positioning of more than one wire. Labeled craniocaudal and lateral films that show the hook wire should be sent to the operating room for the surgeon's orientation. The current diagnostic films may be of additional value to the surgeon. The surgeon should assess the exact location by triangulation (based on the position, depth of penetration, and angle of the wire) and place the incision closest to the tip of the wire to achieve the best cosmetic result (see Fig. 2 of \u201cStandards for Diagnosis and Management of Invasive Breast Carcinoma,\u201d page 97). Tunneling should be avoided, and the skin incision should be made as close to the lesion as possible. The incision should be long enough to permit the removal of the specimen in one piece. Removal of the lesion in numerous fragments should be avoided because doing so precludes margin assessment and size determination. Curvilinear skin incisions are preferable (see Fig. 1 of \u201cStandards for Diagnosis and Management of Invasive Breast Carcinoma,\u201d page 96). Periareolar incisions are not appropriate for lesions in the periphery of the breast. The procedure can be done readily with the patient under local anesthesia with or without intravenous sedation. Meticulous hemostasis is critically important. Hematoma formation produces changes that are difficult to interpret by physical examination. In addition, the evolving scar from a hematoma may make interpretation of mammography difficult. These changes may be long lasting and lead to unnecessary biopsy because of the difficulty in evaluation. A better cosmetic result can be achieved by allowing the biopsy cavity to fill with serum, although reapproximation of the biopsy cavity may be appropriate under some circumstances. Drains in the breast should be avoided. Skin incisions should be closed with a subcuticular technique. The specimen should be radiographed intraoperatively to determine that the mammographic lesion has been excised and to direct pathologic analysis to the site in question in the removed tissue. Magnification and compression of the specimen increase the resolution of the radiograph. The specimen film should be correlated with a preoperative mammogram and interpreted without delay. Absence of the mammographic abnormality on the specimen radiograph usually indicates that it has not been removed. If the diagnosis is DCIS, extension of calcification (or mass) to the margin of the specimen suggests that a residual tumor might be present in the breast and that further resection along that margin may be indicated. The specimen radiograph is not adequate to determine the completeness of excision. Histologically negative margins also do not guarantee complete removal of the lesion because DCIS may grow in a discontinuous fashion. A postoperative mammogram should be obtained to document complete removal of the mammographic abnormality. It can be done as soon as the patient can tolerate compression. Magnification views may be helpful. Margin status and the postoperative mammogram are complementary means of assessing the completeness of excision. If re-excision is done, another postexcision mammogram should be obtained to reassess the tumorectomy site. The previous biopsy site must be re-excised carefully to ensure negative margins of resection, avoid excess removal of breast tissue, and achieve good cosmesis. If the presence of microcalcifications is the indication for reexcision, needle localization should be considered. Proper orientation of the original biopsy specimen avoids removal of an already adequate margin. When the site of inadequate margins is not known, a rim of tissue must be removed around the previous biopsy site. Axillary node metastases are uncommon in DCIS. Axillary dissection is not necessary for the management of most patients with DCIS. Unsuspected invasive or microinvasive carcinoma occurs more frequently in association with extensive DCIS of high nuclear grade. Most of these patients need mastectomy to encompass the disease. Therefore, a low axillary sampling or level I dissection performed when the mastectomy is done avoids a second operative procedure if invasive carcinoma is found in the mastectomy specimen. If a clinically suspicious node is found during surgery, a frozen section should be done, and if the node is positive, a level I and II axillary node dissection should be performed. The excised tissue should be submitted for pathology examination with appropriate clinical history and anatomic site specifications, including laterality (right or left breast) and quadrant. For wide excisions or segmental breast resections, the surgeon should orient the specimen (e.g., superior, medial, lateral) for the pathologist with sutures or other markers. The specimen radiograph should be available for the pathologist to review while examining the specimen. The pathologist's gross examination should document the type of surgical specimen when this information is provided (e.g., excisional biopsy, quadrantectomy), the size of the specimen, and the proximity of the tumor (if visible) or biopsy site to the margins of excision. The presence or absence of tumor at the margins of excision is determined by marking the margins with India ink or using another suitable technique. The entire mammographic lesion, and as much of the remaining specimen as practical, should be submitted for histologic examination. Additionally, the margins of the specimen must be thoroughly evaluated, particularly those closest to the lesion. Frozen-section examination of image-guided needle biopsies of nonpalpable lesions or mammographically directed biopsy done for microcalcifications is strongly discouraged. Distinguishing between atypical ductal hyperplasia and DCIS may be impossible in frozen-section preparations, and small foci of microinvasion may be lost or rendered uninterpretable by freezing artifact. Frozen sections should be prepared only when enough tissue is present that the final diagnosis will not be compromised (i.e., grossly visible tumors larger than 1.0 cm) and when the information is needed for immediate therapeutic decisions. DCIS traditionally has been classified primarily by architectural pattern. In this system, DCIS is divided into comedo, cribriform, micropapillary, papillary, and solid subtypes. This classification was developed at a time when all patients with DCIS were treated by mastectomy, however, and the histologic subclassification of DCIS was largely an academic exercise. With the increasing use of breast-conserving therapy for DCIS, lesions more likely to recur or progress to invasive cancer must be identified. Several new classification systems have been proposed, based primarily on nuclear grade, necrosis, or both. Many studies have supported the clinical relevance of this approach, showing that high nuclear grade or necrosis is associated with a higher risk of early local recurrence after breast-conservation therapy. Although a single classification system for DCIS has not yet been uniformly accepted, the pathologist should clearly report the nuclear grade of the lesion and the presence or absence of necrosis. If a specific grading system for DCIS is used, this should be stated in the pathology report. The report also should include the architectural patterns present because they may have clinical relevance (e.g., the micropapillary pattern may be more prone to involvement of multiple quadrants, independent of nuclear grade). The extent (size) of DCIS is an important factor in treatment decisions. In contrast to most invasive cancers, however, DCIS is difficult to measure because it is usually nonpalpable and cannot be identified grossly. Although precise measurement may not be possible, the pathologist may be able to estimate the extent of DCIS, and this information should be included in the pathology report. Several methods for estimating the extent (size) of DCIS have been suggested, including (1) directly measuring the size of the lesion if it is confined to a single slide; (2) determining the size after submitting the entire specimen for microscopic examination in sequence and in sections of uniform thickness (2 to 3 mm); (3) estimating the percentage of breast tissue involved by DCIS in relation to the total specimen; and (4) reporting the total number of slides examined and the number with DCIS. The assessment of surgical margins is arguably the most important aspect of the pathologic evaluation of breast tumor excisions in patients being considered for breast conservation. Although the definitions of \u201cpositive\u201d and \u201cnegative\u201d margins vary among institutions, microscopic extension of DCIS to surgical margins usually results in further surgery. The pathologist should clearly specify in the pathology report whether DCIS is transected at the surgical margin, and if not, how close the lesion is to the nearest margin. Determinations of estrogen and progesterone receptors, DNA content (ploidy), S-phase, and oncogene amplification are not necessary for noninvasive breast carcinomas. How the specimen was received (e.g., number of pieces, fixative, orientation) The laterality and quadrant of the excised tissue and the type of procedure, as specified by the surgeon Size of the specimen in three dimensions Whether the entire specimen was submitted for histologic examination The histologic features of DCIS (e.g., nuclear grade, necrosis, architectural pattern) An estimate of the extent (size) of DCIS (if possible) The location of microcalcifications (e.g., in DCIS, in benign breast tissue, or both) The presence or absence of DCIS at the margins of excision. If possible, the distance of the lesion or biopsy site from the margin should be stated. Without mature data from clinical trials, it is the collective responsibility of the surgeon, pathologist, radiation oncologist, and radiologist to integrate all available data so that treatment options and recommendations can be articulated clearly to the patient. The surgeon must decide, based on imaging studies and the pathology consultation report, whether the patient is a candidate for a breast-conserving approach. If so, local recurrence must be further discussed. Local recurrence with total mastectomy is rare. Local recurrence is observed at a higher rate in patients treated with breast conservation, but the impact of these local recurrences on overall survival is probably small. Finally, patients need to understand the excellent prognosis for this disease with either surgical approach. Information on 39,010 patients with DCIS of the breast diagnosed between 1985 and 1993 was collected through the National Cancer Data Base. During the 8 years of analysis, the use of breast-conservation therapy increased from 31% to 54%. Tumors with favorable sizes and grades were associated with increased rates of breast preservation and lower rates of axillary dissection and use of radiotherapy. In the early years of the study, radiotherapy was administered to only 38% of patients postoperatively, but by 1993 it was used in 54%. The axilla was dissected in 49% of the patients initially and in 37% by the end of the study. The inappropriately high rate of axillary dissection and the low rate of postoperative radiation therapy should improve through dissemination of clinical trial results and professional education. No prospective randomized trials have compared the treatment of DCIS by mastectomy with treatment by breast conservation. Studies from single institutions, including patients with both clinically evident and mammographically detected DCIS, indicate that 1% to 2% of patients treated by mastectomy will relapse, either regionally or systemically (Table 2). Presumably, relapse is caused by unrecognized foci of invasive tumor present in the breast. Thus, although mastectomy results in cure rates approaching 100%, it may be overtreatment for many patients with DCIS, particularly those with small, mammographically detected lesions. In 1985, the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) began protocol B-17, a prospective randomized study to evaluate the worth of postoperative radiation therapy after lumpectomy for patients with DCIS. The initial results, with an average follow-up of 43 months, were published in 1993.2 Additional details of the pathology were published in 1995.3 In 1997, the results were updated.4 For this analysis, 814 patients were eligible for evaluation, with a mean time in the study of 90 months (range, 67 to 130 months). All patients had been followed for more than 5 years, and 35% had been followed for more than 8 years. Thirty-eight percent of these patients had axillary dissections, all of which were negative. The total number of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrences was 151, and 70 (46.4%) recurrences were invasive. Most of the ipsilateral breast tumor recurrences were at or near the original lesion. Analysis by treatment arm showed 104 ipsilateral breast tumor recurrences among 403 patients treated with lumpectomy only (25.8%) (Table 3). The cumulative rate of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence at 8 years was only slightly higher, 26.8%. (For comparison, the cumulative ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence rate at 5 years reported in 1993 was 20.9%.2) Fifty-one ipsilateral breast tumor recurrences were noninvasive (13.4%) and 53 were invasive (13.4%). The rate of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence was markedly reduced for patients who received radiation therapy in addition to lumpectomy. Only 47 ipsilateral breast tumor recurrences occurred in 411 patients treated with lumpectomy plus radiation therapy (11.4%). The cumulative ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence rate at 8 years was only slightly higher, 12.1%. (Again for comparison, the cumulative ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence rate at 5 years for patients treated with lumpectomy and radiation therapy as reported in 1993 was 10.4%.2) Thirty ipsilateral breast tumor recurrences were noninvasive (8.2%), and 17 were invasive (3.9%) (Table 3). The P values were significantly different when patients who received radiation therapy were compared with patients who did not. The update confirmed the original conclusions of NSABP protocol B-17 that ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence of both invasive and noninvasive breast cancer is significantly reduced by postlumpectomy radiation therapy. In the original analysis, margin status and the presence of comedonecrosis were independent predictors of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence. Other randomized trials that have been started in North America and Europe (Table 4) compare the results achieved using breast-conserving surgery alone with those of breast-conserving surgery plus radiation therapy. All of them (except the Swedish trial) require histologically \u201cnegative\u201d margins as an entry criterion. (Attempts by national cooperative groups in Germany and Denmark to perform randomized trials comparing surgery alone with surgery and radiotherapy had to be abandoned because of poor accrual.) As yet, no data are available from these trials. The results of conservative surgery and radiation for DCIS from retrospective series are presented in Table 5. The crude incidence of breast tumor recurrence ranges from 4% to 18%. Deaths caused by breast cancer have been reported in up to 4% of patients treated in studies with a median follow-up of 10 years or fewer. The long-term results of conservative surgery and radiation for DCIS were reported by Solin et al.5, 6 This collaborative study of 10 institutions in the United States and Europe analyzed outcome in 268 patients. Seventy-eight percent of the tumors were detected by mammography alone. The 10-year actuarial risk of breast recurrence was 16%, and the 10-year actuarial cause-specific survival was 97%.5 The 15-year actuarial breast recurrence was 19%, and the 15-year actuarial cause-specific survival was 96%. Median follow-up was 10.3 years.6 Various clinical, pathologic, and treatment-related factors have been assessed for their ability to identify patients with a substantial risk of recurrence in the treated breast. For these patients, mastectomy may be recommended. One factor that appears to be associated with a high risk of recurrence is the presence of residual malignant-appearing calcifications on a postbiopsy mammogram. Failure to remove these calcifications before radiation has resulted in a 100% recurrence rate in the few patients reported.7, 8 DCIS presenting as a bloody nipple discharge was noted in earlier series to be associated with a higher risk of recurrence. In the collaborative study, however, no increased risk appeared to exist in this group of patients.6 The significance of young age (less than 40 years) is controversial. Three studies have observed an increased risk of breast tumor recurrence (approximately 25%) in young women who have DCIS treated with conservative surgery and radiation compared with older women (approximately 10%).9-11 However, four additional studies have found no correlation between young age and breast recurrence rates.6, 8, 12, 13 A similar controversy exists regarding a positive family history of breast cancer. Two series7, 12 have reported a higher breast tumor recurrence rate (approximately 40%) in women with a positive family history compared with those who do not have such a history (approximately 10%). However, a third series found no such association.10 The impact of young age and a positive family history of breast cancer on treatment options in women with DCIS requires further evaluation. The contribution of various pathologic factors (histologic subtype, nuclear grade, necrosis) to the risk of breast recurrence in patients treated with conservative surgery and radiation is controversial. It was suggested initially that high-grade or comedo DCIS was associated with a higher rate of breast tumor recurrence.5, 14 However, in the collaborative study, the 10-year actuarial breast recurrence rate was 18% for tumors with the combination of both comedo pattern and a high nuclear grade versus 15% for DCIS in which these factors were absent (P = 0.15).6 The median interval to recurrence for comedo DCIS was 3.1 years versus 6.5 years for non-comedo DCIS. Therefore, series with shorter follow-up tend to underestimate the number of recurrences in low-grade or non-comedo DCIS, and recurrences in high-grade or comedo DCIS predominate. The influence of necrosis on breast recurrence rates remains to be determined. Silverstein and colleagues15 have designed the Van Nuys Prognostic Index. This is a quantitative algorithm that uses tumor size, margin width, and a pathologic classification based on nuclear grade and comedo-type necrosis to predict the likelihood of local recurrence with breast-conservation treatment for patients with DCIS. Scores range from a low of 3 (best prognosis) to a high of 9 (worst prognosis). Their results suggest that patients who score 3 or 4 generally have small, well-excised, low-grade lesions that can be treated successfully with excision alone. The Van Nuys Prognostic Index must be confirmed by others before it is accepted for widespread use. Most breast tumor recurrences in patients undergoing conservative surgery and radiation for DCIS occur near the primary tumor, and approximately 50% are invasive cancers.6-8, 12, 14, 16-20 Invasive recurrences appear at later intervals (5 years) than do noninvasive recurrences (4 years) and may occur in a separate quadrant.9, 17 Nearly all patients who develop a noninvasive recurrence are salvaged with mastectomy, and approximately 75% of those with an invasive recurrence are salvaged.7, 8, 12, 16, 18-21 Over the last 10 years, the method of detection of DCIS has changed significantly. Approximately 85% of all DCIS is now detected solely as a mammographic finding, which is most often characterized by the presence of microcalcifications. Earlier reports of conservative surgery and radiation for DCIS do not accurately reflect outcome for mammographically detected DCIS because many included clinically evident DCIS (palpable mass or bloody nipple discharge), and detailed mammographic and pathologic correlation was frequently lacking. Unfortunately, the results of these earlier series were compared with those of conservative surgery alone for mammographically detected DCIS and often claimed to be equal. The results of conservative surgery and radiation for mammographically detected DCIS are shown in Table 6. The 10-year actuarial breast tumor recurrence rate ranges from 6% to 23%, with a 10-year cause-specific survival of 96% to 100%. The variation in the results reported reflects differences in patient selection, the extent of surgical resection, and the degree of mammographic and pathologic correlation. Increasing evidence exists that wide surgical excision8 and negative margins of resection diminish the risk of breast tumor recurrence in patients with mammographically detected DCIS treated with conservative surgery and radiation.8, 9, 22 In the collaborative study (which had a median follow-up of 9.3 years), the crude breas"}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2069735760", "relevance_score":

The term stereotactic refers to precise positioning of the target volume within three-dimensional (3D) space. The target volume is usually localized in space using some external frame of reference that can be related to the treatment machine. The term body is used to distinguish the technique from the current terminology of stereotactic radiosurgery used for radiation treatment of central nervous system lesions with a full course of therapy consisting of five or fewer treatments. Stereotactic positioning can be precise, and as a result, stereotactic radiotherapy commonly uses higher doses per fraction and fewer fractions (hypofractionation) than conventional radiation. As defined by the Current Procedural Terminology Editorial Panel of the American Medical Association, SBRT consists of a total course of therapy comprising five or fewer treatments.Description of TechnologyTarget localization and trackingAn overriding principle of radiotherapy is to maximize the dose delivered to the tumor while sparing normal tissue to the greatest extent possible. This ideally increases the probability of tumor control and decreases the probability of normal tissue complication. In the case of the hypofractionation related to SBRT, this principle becomes even more important because any inaccuracy in patient setup can potentially result in severely harmful consequences.Although target stereotaxis, immobilization, and tracking are essential to fully benefit from hypofractionation, a discussion of the numerous devices and techniques developed to addresses these needs is beyond the scope of this evaluation and will be the subject of subsequent reports.Treatment deliveryTypically, multiple, nonopposing, and often noncoplanar arcs, spread in a large solid angle with fairly equal weighting, are used to provide a high level of conformality (1Kavanagh B.D.

This method reduces the entrance dose and the volume of the irradiated normal tissue.In deciding the number of beam directions and the relative beam weights, entrance dose should be kept to a modest level to prevent potential severe skin toxicity while keeping a uniform isotropic dose falloff (2Chang B.K. Timmerman R.D. Stereotactic body radiation therapy: A comprehensive review.Am J Clin Oncol. 2007; 30: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In the beam's-eye view, each beam is evaluated to coincide with the planning target volume (PTV). Typically, an isodose line of 60\u201380% provides 95% coverage of the PTV and is used to prescribe the treatment.Three major criteria are used to evaluate the dosimetric properties of the SBRT plan: conformity index, high-dose spillage, and intermediate-dose spillage. The conformity index is defined as the ratio of the volume of the isodose shell that provides 95% coverage to the PTV. It is generally recommended that this ratio be kept to less than 1.2. High-dose spillage is defined as any volume receiving greater than 105% of the prescription and should be confined to the PTV. Intermediate-dose spillage is responsible for most of the toxicity associated with SBRT and can be characterized in two ways: (1) as the ratio of the 50% isodose volume to the PTV, or (2) by the dose to any point 2 cm away from the PTV. Either or both methods can be used, and intermediate-dose spillage should be minimized to limit toxicity. Dose\u2013volume histogram criteria, commonly used with 3D-conformal radiotherapy or intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), have not been established.In delivering SBRT, many commercially available systems are used. Sophisticated image guidance is a feature common to these treatment systems. Systems equipped with image guidance minimize the uncertainty associated with tumor localization. Most delivery systems also allow integration of immobilization devices. The most prevalent treatment systems used are the Novalis (BrainLAB, Feldkirchen, Germany), the TomoTherapy Hi-Art System (TomoTherapy, Madison, WI), the Varian Trilogy (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA), the Elekta Synergy (Elekta, Norcross, GA), the Siemens Oncor and Artiste (Siemens Medical Solutions, Malvern, PA), and the CyberKnife Robotic Radiosurgery System (Accuray, Sunnyvale, CA).The Novalis system uses a 6-MV linear accelerator with micro-multileaf collimators ranging in leaf thickness from 3 to 5.5 mm. Two KVp orthogonal X-ray cameras are mounted on the system to track bony landmarks or implanted fiducials in relation to the digitally reconstructed radiographs generated from computed tomography (CT) simulation. The patient is then aligned in the treatment position in accordance with identified positions of markers.The TomoTherapy system uses a megavoltage CT to continuously image the patient, with the table continuously moving when IMRT is delivered throughout a full range of 360\u00b0 rotations using a binary multileaf collimator system.The Varian Trilogy and Elekta Synergy both use a cone-beam CT to provide real-time image guidance for repositioning. Elekta has recently acquired a company (3D Line Medical Systems, Norcross, GA) whose product was a full stereotactic system for cranial and extracranial radiotherapy treatments. The system is composed of a micro-multileaf collimator system with leaf thicknesses of 3 mm, 5 mm, or 7 mm, head and body frames for positioning and localization, dynamic patient support assembly with all translational, rotational, pitch, yaw, and roll movement, and an integrated optical tracking system for positioning. An inverse treatment-planning package with intensity-modulated arc therapy capability is also included.The Siemens system is different in that the CT unit is linked to the accelerator via a shared tabletop, and it travels along rails. Once CT imaging is completed the tabletop rotates to the linear accelerator for treatment delivery, thereby providing a near real-time localization for treatment delivery.The CyberKnife uses a frameless image-guided process to direct a robotic arm equipped with a linear accelerator. Translational and rotational movements of this robotic treatment are much broader and impossible to match with existing designs of linear accelerators. Two orthogonal diagnostic X-ray cameras are mounted on the ceiling to provide real-time imaging for tracking. Implanted fiducials or reliable bony landmarks are used to localize the tumor in real time for treatment delivery.Rationale for prostate SBRTProstate cancer lends itself to the use of SBRT because approximately 90% of cases present with disease clinically localized in the prostate. Furthermore, biologic models have suggested that prostate cancer may benefit from the use of fewer, larger treatment fractions, otherwise known as hypofractionation, which can vary in intensity. Stereotactic body radiotherapy, an accelerated form of hypofractionation, may be well suited for prostate cancer because it uses five or fewer fractions. Understanding the complexity of this issue requires a discussion of the radiobiology principals used.Radiobiology (early vs. late effects and the \u03b1/\u03b2 ratio)Conventional prostate radiotherapy is delivered in fraction sizes of 1.8\u20132.0 Gy. This method of fractionation emerged from the observation that late complications of radiotherapy have been reduced without an apparent compromise in local control. This approach is supported by the radiobiologic nature of surrounding normal tissues, such as the rectum.Hypofractionation and SBRT present several potential advantages. Ideally, tumor control may be increased for a given level of late complications. Conversely, late complications may be reduced for a given level of tumor control. Patient convenience would increase with fewer fractions compared with standard external-beam radiotherapy treatment courses that extend for 7\u20139 weeks. Equipment utilization and staffing may be more efficient, which may translate to increased cost-efficiency.Prostate cancer may not be typical of other tumors. The sensitivity of tissue to fractionation can be expressed as the \u03b1/\u03b2 ratio. Tissues with a small \u03b1/\u03b2 ratio (i.e., 2\u20134 Gy) are more sensitive to changes in fractionation than tissue with a large \u03b1/\u03b2 ratio (i.e., >8 Gy). Tissues with a low \u03b1/\u03b2 ratio are commonly referred to as \u201clate-responding\u201d because sequelae of treatment are generally seen years after treatment. Increasing the number of fractions generally spares late-responding tissues. Tumors are generally less sensitive to the effects of fractionation due to relatively large \u03b1/\u03b2 ratios more characteristic of \u201cearly-responding\u201d tissues. In general, increasing the number of fractions spares \u201clate-responding\u201d normal tissue while impacting minimally on the tumor. However, prostate cancer may not be an early-responding tumor. Instead it may be a late-responding tumor for which increasing fractionation may provide a sparing effect that limits or reduces the therapeutic ratio. If this is true, hypofractionation may be more effective for cell killing.Alpha/beta ratio for prostate cancerBrenner and Hall (3Brenner D.J. Hall E.J. Fractionation and protraction for radiotherapy of prostate carcinoma.Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1999; 43: 1095-1101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar) hypothesized that the \u03b1/\u03b2 ratio for prostate cancer may be small because prostate tumors contain unusually small proportions of cycling cells (4Haustermans K. Hofland I. Poppel H. et al.Cell kinetic measurements in prostate cancer.Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1997; 37: 1067-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). They estimated the \u03b1/\u03b2 ratio for prostate cancer to be 1.5 Gy (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.8\u20132.2 Gy) by using clinical data to assume the linear and quadratic components of cell killing.

Using this method, most studies support this hypothesis and suggest that the \u03b1/\u03b2 ratio is low, probably 1\u20134 Gy (22Brenner D.J.

If the \u03b1/\u03b2 ratio is low for prostate cancer this would support SBRT at the risk of increased late side effects. But if the \u03b1/\u03b2 ratio is not low, SBRT may increase the risk for late toxicity and impair tumor control, thereby inverting the therapeutic ratio.Some of the problems with the estimates of the \u03b1/\u03b2 ratio include nonuniform dose distributions, tumor heterogeneity, varying relative biologic effectiveness (15Dale R.G. Jones B. Is the alpha/beta for prostate tumors really low?

The linear-quadratic model is a simple application that does not take into account other fractionation-related phenomena, such as reoxygenation, redistribution, and repopulation. A detailed discussion of these issues has been published by Dasu (24Dasu A.

This yielded a value for \u03b1/\u03b2 of 1.2 Gy (95% CI, 0.03\u20134.1 Gy). A similarly low \u03b1/\u03b2 ratio of 1.5 Gy (95% CI, 1.2\u20131.8 Gy) has been supported by larger studies (10Fowler J.

Using this method the \u03b1/\u03b2 ratio for the rectum was determined to be 5.4 \u00b1 1.5. This is consistent with most estimates in animals.If the \u03b1/\u03b2 ratio for rectal damage is higher than that for prostate, then larger hypofractionated doses could be given with correspondingly larger clinical gains for the same constant late complication rates (26Fowler J.F.

If, however, the \u03b1/\u03b2 ratio of late rectal reactions were smaller than that of the prostate, the incidence of complications would be increased. The relative increase is estimated to rise by factors of 1.15 at 15 fractions or 1.25 at 5 fractions (26Fowler J.F.

Such low numbers of fractions is the \u201cworst case\u201d likely, meaning that if a given complication were normally 5% it could rise to 6.3%, when using only 5 fractions (26Fowler J.F.

Most trials have studied modest increases in daily fraction size while concerns of increased rectal toxicity predominate. Some investigators have introduced much more substantial hypofractionated regimens.National Cancer Institute of CanadaIn a Phase III randomized trial, conventional radiotherapy was used to compare 52.5 Gy in 20 fractions with 66 Gy in 33 fractions, a much lower dose than thought adequate by modern standards (37Lukka H. Hayter C. Julian J.A. et al.Randomized trial comparing two fractionation schedules for patients with localized prostate cancer.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 6132-6138Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The primary outcome was a composite of biochemical (three consecutive rises in prostate-specific antigen [PSA]) or clinical failure. The study was designed as a noninferiority investigation with a predefined tolerance of 7.5%, and a sample size of 940 men was estimated to provide approximately 80% power to demonstrate noninferiority.Between March 1995 and December 1998, 470 patients received the long arm and 466 patients received the short arm. The median follow-up time for all patients was 5.7 years. The Kaplan-Meier rate of biochemical failure (BF) and clinical failure in the long arm was 52.95% and in the short arm was 59.95%. The difference was 7.0% (90% CI, 12.58\u20131.42%), less than the predefined tolerance of 7.5%, so inferiority of the short arm could not be excluded. Biochemical failure (nadir + 2 ng/mL PSA [nadir + 2]) was 37.7% for the long arm and 42.3% for the short arm.Acute combined gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicity (National Cancer Institute of Canada criteria) was less in the conventional group: 7.0% of patients in the conventional group and 11.4% of patients in the hypofractionation group experienced Grade 3 or 4 gastrointestinal or genitourinary toxicities (risk difference 4.4%; 95% CI, 8.1\u20130.6%). Combined late toxicity was comparable, with 3.2% of patients in both treatment arms experiencing severe toxicities (risk difference 0.0; 95% CI, 2.4\u20132.3%). Overall, genitourinary toxicity represented two thirds of these events.Royal Adelaide HospitalIn Australia, conventional radiotherapy was used to compare 55 Gy in 20 fractions (Biologic equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions [BED2Gy] = 64 Gy, \u03b1/\u03b2 = 3 Gy) to 64 Gy in 32 fractions, a dose lower than that of the National Cancer Institute of Canada (38Yeoh E.E.

This trial was designed to detect a difference in the frequency of mild late radiation morbidity of 20% (40% vs. 20%), with 90% power, and required recruiting 110 patients in each treatment schedule. The primary endpoint of the study was a comparison of late radiation morbidity between the treatment groups after a minimum follow-up of 2 years. Sixty-one patients received conventional fractionation, and 59 received hypofractionation. In the first 120 consecutive patients, with a median follow-up of 43.5 months, there was no difference in clinically significant toxicity or any of the measures of treatment efficacy between the two arms (38Yeoh E.E.

This trial focused on intermediate- and high-risk patients. Up to 4 months of androgen deprivation was permitted, and long-term androgen deprivation was used for high-risk patients. Overall, there was little difference in acute morbidity between the standard and short arms, likely a result of the strict normal tissue dose constraints used.

In most countries, women constitute substantially fewer than half of radiologists in academia or private practice despite frequently accounting for at least half of medical school enrolees. Furthermore, the proportion of women decreases at higher academic ranks and levels of leadership, a phenomenon which has been referred to as a \"leaky pipeline\". Gender diversity in the radiologic workplace, including in academic and leadership positions, is important for the present and future success of the field. It is a tool for excellence that helps to optimize patient care and research; moreover, it is essential to overcome the current shortage of radiologists. This article reviews the current state of gender diversity in academic and leadership positions in radiology internationally and explores a wide range of potential reasons for gender disparities, including the lack of role models and mentorship, unconscious bias and generational changes in attitudes about the desirability of leadership positions. Strategies for both individuals and institutions to proactively increase the representation of women in academic and leadership positions are suggested. KEY POINTS: \u2022 Gender-diverse teams perform better. Thus, gender diversity throughout the radiologic workplace, including in leadership positions, is important for the current and future success of the field. \u2022 Though women now make up roughly half of medical students, they remain underrepresented among radiology trainees, faculty and leaders. \u2022 Factors leading to the gender gap in academia and leadership positions in Radiology include a lack of role models and mentors, unconscious biases, other societal barriers and generational changes."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2022682809", "relevance_score": 307.18515, "publication_year": 2001, "title": "Radiologic Diagnosis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma", "cited_by_count": 52, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Hepatocellular carcinoma", "level": 2, "score": 0.8181751}, {"display_name": "Cirrhosis", "level": 2, "score": 0.6647701}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.6123837}, {"display_name": "Blood supply", "level": 2, "score": 0.56355786}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Substantial": [0], "recent": [1, 53], "technologic": [2, 135], "improvements": [3], "in": [4, 15, 29], "CT": [5, 73, 141], "scanning,": [6, 8, 74, 76], "US": [7, 75, 145], "and": [9, 92, 143, 146], "MR": [10, 78, 147], "imaging,": [11], "together": [12], "with": [13, 95, 105, 131], "advances": [14, 28, 136], "the": [16, 19, 87, 98, 119, 154], "understanding": [17], "of": [18, 22, 40, 50, 56, 66, 89, 100, 157], "optimal": [20], "application": [21], "contrast": [23, 148], "administration": [24], "techniques,": [25], "have": [26, 111], "facilitated": [27], "radiologic": [30], "imaging": [31, 48, 155], "detection": [32, 49, 88], "for": [33, 47], "HCC": [34, 67], "diagnosis.": [35], "Despite": [36], "a": [37, 44], "large": [38, 57], "number": [39], "earlier": [41], "publications": [42], "reporting": [43], "high": [45], "sensitivity": [46], "HCC,": [51], "more": [52], "screening": [54], "studies": [55], "cirrhotic": [58, 115, 158], "populations": [59], "confirm": [60], "that": [61, 103], "only": [62], "37%": [63], "to": [64, 85, 93, 113], "45%": [65], "tumor": [68], "nodules": [69, 116], "are": [70], "detected": [71], "by": [72, 117], "or": [77, 122], "imaging.": [79], "Future": [80], "investigation": [81, 151], "will": [82], "include": [83], "efforts": [84], "improve": [86, 153], "small": [90, 109], "tumors": [91], "characterize": [94, 114], "greater": [96], "specificity": [97], "spectrum": [99], "nodular": [101], "changes": [102], "occur": [104], "cirrhosis.": [106], "Although": [107], "several": [108], "series": [110], "attempted": [112], "evaluating": [118], "relative": [120], "arterial": [121], "portal": [123], "blood": [124], "supply,": [125], "these": [126], "preliminary": [127], "results": [128], "require": [129], "substantiation": [130], "larger": [132], "series.": [133], "Continued": [134], "such": [137], "as": [138], "multidetector": [139], "helical": [140], "scanning": [142], "new": [144], "agents": [149], "under": [150], "may": [152], "characterization": [156], "nodules.": [159]}, "authors": ["Mark S.

The active learning begins the training phase with nodules on which radiologists\u2019 semantic ratings agree, and incrementally learns how to classify nodules on which the radiologists do not agree.

Recent developments in data mining technologies, such as natural language processing (NLP), have provided the medical informatics community with an opportunity to quantify report concepts, such as uncertainty. The challenge ahead lies in taking the next step from quantification to understanding, which requires combining standardized report content, data mining, and artificial intelligence; thereby creating Knowledge Discovery Databases (KDD). The development of this database technology will expand our ability to record, track, and analyze report data, along with the potential to create data-driven and automated decision support technologies at the point of care.

The usefulness of these methods is illustrated by a number of clinical cases. Segmentation is the process of assigning labels to pixels in 2D images or voxels in 3D images. Typically the effect is that the image is split up into segments, also called regions or areas. In medical imaging it is essential for quantification of outlined structures and for 3D visualization of relevant image data. Based on the level of implemented model knowledge we have classified these methods into (1) manual delineation, (2) low-level segmentation, and (3) model-based segmentation. Pure manual delineation of structures in a series of images is time-consuming and user-dependent and should therefore be restricted to quick experiments. Low-level segmentation analyzes the image locally at each pixel in the image and is practically limited to high-contrast images. Model-based segmentation uses knowledge of object structure such as global shape or semantic context. It typically requires an initialization, for example in the form of a rough approximation of the contour to be found. In practice it turns out that the use of high-level knowledge, e.g. anatomical knowledge, in the segmentation algorithm is quite complicated. Generally, the number of clinical applications decreases with the level and extent of prior knowledge needed by the segmentation algorithm. Most problems of segmentation inaccuracies can be overcome by human interaction. Promising segmentation methods for complex images are therefore user-guided and thus semi-automatic. They require manual intervention and guidance and consist of fast and accurate refinement techniques to assist the human operator."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W3164323420", "relevance_score":

information from radiology reports. Understanding recent developments in NLP application to radiology is of significance but recent reviews on this are limited. This study systematically assesses and quantifies recent literature in NLP applied to radiology reports. Methods We conduct an automated literature search yielding 4836 results using automated filtering, metadata enriching steps and citation search combined with manual review. Our analysis is based on 21 variables including radiology characteristics, NLP methodology, performance, study, and clinical application characteristics. Results We present a comprehensive analysis of the 164 publications retrieved with publications in 2019 almost triple those in 2015. Each publication is categorised into one of 6 clinical application categories. Deep learning use increases in the period but conventional machine learning approaches are still prevalent. Deep learning remains challenged when data is scarce and there is little evidence of adoption into clinical practice. Despite 17% of studies reporting greater than 0.85 F1 scores, it is hard to comparatively evaluate these approaches given that most of them use different datasets. Only 14 studies made their data and 15 their code available with 10 externally validating results. Conclusions Automated understanding of clinical narratives of the radiology reports has the potential to enhance the healthcare process and we show that research in this field continues to grow. Reproducibility and explainability of models are important if the domain is to move applications into clinical use. More could be done to share code enabling validation of methods on different institutional data and to reduce heterogeneity in reporting of study properties allowing inter-study comparisons. Our results have significance for researchers in the field providing a systematic synthesis of existing work to build on, identify gaps, opportunities for collaboration and avoid duplication."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W3032188200", "relevance_score": 245.76567, "publication_year": 2020, "title": "COVID-19: A Multimodality Review of Radiologic Techniques, Clinical Utility, and Imaging Features", "cited_by_count": 52, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)", "level": 4, "score": 0.7135587}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.6926775}, {"display_name": "Radiography", "level": 2, "score": 0.6030206}, {"display_name": "Pneumonia", "level": 2, "score": 0.5792542}, {"display_name": "Magnetic resonance imaging", "level": 2, "score": 0.5747939}, {"display_name": "Multimodality", "level": 2, "score": 0.49051636}, {"display_name": "Conventional radiography", "level": 3, "score": 0.47183707}, {"display_name": "Ultrasound", "level": 2, "score": 0.43527246}, {"display_name": "2019-20 coronavirus outbreak", "level": 3, "score": 0.43191364}, {"display_name": "Modalities", "level": 2, "score": 0.43056843}, {"display_name": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)", "level": 5, "score": 0.42271408}, {"display_name": "Disease", "level": 2, "score": 0.30573377}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"In": [0], "this": [1, 53, 66], "article": [2], "we": [3], "will": [4], "review": [5], "the": [6, 29], "imaging": [7], "features": [8], "of": [9, 52], "coronavirus": [10], "disease": [11, 54], "2019": [12], "(COVID-19)": [13], "across": [14], "multiple": [15], "modalities,": [16], "including": [17], "radiography,": [18], "CT,": [19, 72], "MRI,": [20], "PET/CT,": [21, 80], "and": [22, 59, 70], "US.": [23], "Given": [24], "that": [25], "COVID-19": [26], "primarily": [27], "affects": [28], "lung": [30], "parenchyma": [31], "by": [32], "causing": [33], "pneumonia,": [34], "our": [35], "directive": [36], "is": [37, 63], "to": [38, 48, 55], "focus": [39], "on": [40], "thoracic": [41], "findings": [42], "associated": [43], "with": [44], "COVID-19.": [45], "We": [46], "aim": [47], "enhance": [49], "radiologists\u2019": [50], "understanding": [51], "help": [56], "guide": [57], "diagnosis": [58], "management.": [60], "Supplemental": [61], "material": [62], "available": [64], "for": [65], "article.": [67], "Keywords:": [68], "Adults": [69], "Pediatrics,": [71], "Conventional": [73], "Radiography,": [74], "Echocardiography,": [75], "Infection,": [76], "MR-Imaging,": [77], "Neural": [78], "Networks,": [79], "Ultrasound": [81], "\u00a9": [82], "RSNA,": [83], "2020": [84]}, "authors": ["Sayan Manna", "Jill Wruble", "Samuel Z.

A study of agreement between different measures of kyphosis, a clinical standing measure (Debrunner kyphometer; Protek AG, Bern, Switzerland) versus a supine radiologic measure (Cobb angle). Objectives. To determine whether a supine radiologic measure of kyphosis in older women is a reasonable estimate of clinical kyphosis determined in the standing position, and to investigate a computerized assessment of the Cobb angle. Summary of Background Data. Few studies have investigated kyphosis measurement agreement involving older adults. Methods. Using data from the Fracture Intervention Trial, we randomly selected 120 women, aged 55\u201380 years, who had a Debrunner kyphometer measure of kyphosis and supine lateral spine radiographs from which we measured the Cobb angle (either manually or by digitization). We calculated the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) from repeated measures analysis of variance to assess the agreement among the: (1) manual Cobb angle and Debrunner kyphometer, (2) digitized Cobb angle and Debrunner kyphometer, and (3) manual and digitized Cobb angle. Results. The mean of both the manual and digitized Cobb angle was 45\u00b0 (range 18\u00b0\u201383\u00b0), and the mean Debrunner kyphometer reading was 48\u00b0 (range 17\u00b0\u201383\u00b0). The ICC between either of the 2 measures of the Cobb angle and Debrunner measurement was 0.68, indicating reasonable agreement. The ICC between the manual and digitized Cobb angle was 0.99, indicating excellent agreement. Conclusions. There is reasonable agreement between a supine radiologic and standing clinical measurement of kyphosis in older women. The degree of agreement between standing and lying measures of kyphosis in older women is not known. We compared the Cobb angle reading (performed both manually and by digitization) from supine radiographs with the standing clinical Debrunner protractor measurement and report reasonable (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.68) to excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.99) agreement between the different measures."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2951860343", "relevance_score":

Davidson J.C. Nikolic B. et al.Standards of Practice Committee, with Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe (CIRSE) EndorsementConsensus guidelines for periprocedural management of coagulation status and hemostasis risk in percutaneous image-guided interventions.J Vasc Interv Radiol. 2012; 23: 727-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), which was subsequently revised in 2013 with a discussion of newer anticoagulant agents (2Patel I.J. Davidson J.C. Nikolic B. et al.Standards of Practice Committee, with Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe (CIRSE) EndorsementAddendum of newer anticoagulants to the SIR consensus guideline.J Vasc Interv Radiol. 2013; 24: 641-645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present update to both documents incorporates a multidisciplinary approach to the periprocedural management of coagulation status with emphasis on the patient\u2019s clinically relevant comorbidities, and will be divided into 2 parts: part I will review classes of anticoagulation medications and clinical considerations common to patients requiring percutaneous image-guided interventions; part II will discuss recommendations. The Standards Division of SIR provides evidence-based clinical practice documents to ensure patient safety and enhance the delivery of patient care. Standards Division members are leaders in the field of interventional radiology from the private and academic sectors of medicine who dedicate the vast majority of their professional time to performing interventional procedures, and, as such, they represent a broad expert constituency of the subject matter under consideration for standards development. Topics for standards document development are solicited through an annual survey that allows SIR members the opportunity to submit topics for consideration. The proposed topics are approved and prioritized by the Executive Council. A recognized expert or group of experts is identified to serve as the principal author or writing group for the document. Additional authors or societies may be sought to increase the scope, depth, and quality of the document depending on the magnitude of the project. An in-depth literature search is performed by using electronic medical literature databases, such as Medline (via PubMed) and The Cochrane Library. A critical review of peer-reviewed articles is performed with regard to the study methodology, results, and conclusions. All documents have adopted an updated methodology for evidence grading and assessment of strength of recommendation (Appendixes A and B, available online on the article\u2019s Supplemental Material page at www.jvir.org) to fulfill the Institute of Medicine standards for guidelines development. Accepted definitions of the hierarchical classification of evidence, commonly used by systems such as Oxford and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation, are included, and an assessment of the strength of recommendation is defined to assist in clinical decision-making (3Guyatt G.H. Oxman A.D. Vist G.E. et al.GRADE Working Group. GRADE: an emerging consensus on rating quality of evidence and strength of recommendations.Br Med J. 2008; 336: 924-926Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4OCEBM Levels of Evidence Working GroupThe Oxford 2011 Levels of Evidence.https://www.cebm.net/index.aspx?o=5653Date: 2011Date accessed: May 16, 2018Google Scholar). Similar classification systems are used by other specialty practice societies such as the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (5Jacobs A.K. Anderson J.L. Halperin J.L. et al.The evolution and future of ACC/AHA clinical practice guidelines: a 30-year journey: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on practice guidelines.Circulation. 2014; 130: 1208-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The level of evidence assessment is used to create the evidence tables that inform the standards documents. For documents that incorporate clinical recommendations, the strength of recommendation is used to denote how well the recommendation is supported by systematic evidence. When the evidence of literature is weak, conflicting, or contradictory, a modified Delphi technique may be used to enhance effective decision-making (6Fink A. Kosecoff J. Chassin M. Brook R.H. Consensus methods: characteristics and guidelines for use.Am J Public Health. 1984; 74: 979-983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Leape L.L. Hilborne L.H. Park R.E. et al.The appropriateness of use of coronary artery bypass graft surgery in New York State.JAMA. 1993; 269: 753-760Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and consensus for the parameter is reached when 80% of panelists are in agreement. The draft document is critically reviewed by the writing group and members of the Standards Division by telephone conference call or face-to-face meeting. Comments are discussed by the members of the Standards Division, and appropriate revisions made to create the final document before peer review, approval by the SIR Operations Committee, and journal publication."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W1987190667", "relevance_score": 337.09772, "publication_year": 1986, "title": "New concepts in the non-Hodgkin lymphomas: radiologic implications.", "cited_by_count": 51, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Stage (stratigraphy)", "level": 2, "score": 0.55456305}, {"display_name": "Disease", "level": 2, "score": 0.53288215}, {"display_name": "Presentation (obstetrics)", "level": 2, "score": 0.50092745}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.48646924}, {"display_name": "Lymphoma", "level": 2, "score": 0.4591538}, {"display_name": "Pathology", "level": 1, "score": 0.42203003}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Non-Hodgkin": [0], "lymphomas": [1], "are": [2, 55, 85], "a": [3, 18, 68], "heterogeneous": [4], "group": [5], "of": [6, 15, 28, 38, 62, 82, 89, 94], "neoplasms": [7, 40, 84], "believed": [8], "to": [9], "be": [10], "derived": [11], "in": [12, 32, 67, 87], "the": [13, 21, 29, 33, 42, 63, 90, 95], "majority": [14], "cases": [16], "from": [17], "common": [19, 79], "ancestor,": [20], "lymphocyte.": [22], "The": [23, 47, 76], "clinical": [24, 74], "and": [25, 36, 52, 73, 78], "radiologic": [26, 80], "implications": [27], "newer": [30], "concepts": [31], "classification,": [34, 59], "staging,": [35], "treatment": [37, 53], "these": [39, 83], "form": [41], "basis": [43], "for": [44], "this": [45], "review.": [46], "disease": [48, 65], "course,": [49], "staging": [50], "requirements,": [51], "strategies": [54], "determined": [56], "by": [57], "histologic": [58], "prognostic": [60], "grade": [61], "tumor,": [64], "presentation": [66], "nodal": [69], "or": [70], "extranodal": [71], "site,": [72], "stage.": [75], "unique": [77], "features": [81], "reviewed": [86], "each": [88], "major": [91], "anatomic": [92], "regions": [93], "body.": [96]}, "authors": ["David G.

The approval was a notable event for two reasons: The basic training schematic in IR was changed from a 1-4-1 pattern (years of internship-years of DR-years of IR) to a 1-3-2 pattern, and IR was recognized as a primary specialty of the American Board of Radiology (ABR). Of critical importance and by careful design, IR remains a part of radiology, interventional radiologists remain radiologists, and the new programs will reside within radiology departments and report to DR chairs. The new certificate signifies competence in both DR and IR. Nevertheless, this is a big change for radiology and engenders much passionate discussion among stakeholders (2).A brief summary of the history of this change may be useful to the reader. The impetus for change in IR training has existed since the initial recognition of vascular and interventional radiology (VIR) as a subspecialty of radiology by the ABMS in 1994 (3). The major driver of this change has been the importance of nonprocedural patient care in IR, and therefore the need to provide this additional training. In addition, the practice of IR is now far more complex than in 1994, when a 1-year fellowship was adequate.In 2000, the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) created the voluntary Clinical Pathway in IR, in which a resident has 16 months of training in patient care specialties, 29 months of training in DR, 24 months of training in IR, and 3 months of research (4). The ABR agreed to examine graduates of this program because it was essentially a modification of the existing Holman Pathway (a training pathway that allows 18\u201321 months of research [5]). However, only a handful of programs implemented this Clinical Pathway.In 2005, the ABR approved another voluntary alternate pathway called the DIRECT (Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology Enhanced Clinical Training) Pathway (6). This provisional pilot pathway was intended to provide accelerated training for residents inclined toward clinical care and intervention who were transferring from other specialties. The ABR counts 2 years of clinical training toward fulfillment of the DR requirements, decreasing the overall duration of training in DR and IR by 1 year. Thus, DIRECT residents have 24 months of training in patient care specialties, 27 months of training in DR, and 21 months of training in VIR. The DIRECT Pathway has been successful in a few institutions, but, like the VIR Clinical Pathway, has not been widely adopted.In 2006, the SIR commissioned a Primary Certificate Task Force to develop a proposal for a primary certificate in IR. The justification for a primary certificate (and therefore recognition as a specialty) was the unique combination of competencies that constitute IR: imaging, procedures, and nonprocedural patient care. The last of these three competencies is what distinguishes IR from a focused area of practice (or subspecialty) of DR. In 2007, the ABR agreed to support such a proposal, which was ultimately presented to the ABMS in 2009. The proposed training would have resulted in certification in IR alone. This was rejected by the ABMS based in part on details of the training that did not adequately address imaging competency; however, permission was given for resubmission of a revised proposal. A 2-year process of reexamination of the concept, assessment of stakeholder needs, collaborative development with key radiology partners such as the Association of Program Directors in Radiology (APDR) and the Society of Chairs of Academic Radiology Departments, compromise, and garnering of consensus and support from within DR followed (7). This approach resulted in a major change in the structure of the proposed training, which now consisted of 3 years of DR followed by 2 years of IR. In this proposal, two additional DR rotations (mammography and nuclear medicine) and one clinical rotation (in the intensive care unit [ICU]) were required during the IR years. The graduate would be an individual certified in both DR and IR. At one point, the proposal was debated publicly by more than 400 delegates representing the gamut of DR at the 2011 American College of Radiology (ACR) Annual Meeting and Chapter Leadership Conference (8). The delegates voted unanimously to lend ACR support to the proposal as an additional training pathway. It is worth noting that the training proposed for the IR/DR certificate had more DR training (35 months) than either the earlier Clinical or DIRECT Pathways or the Holman Pathway.The final proposal was structured to take advantage of the new DR curriculum, in that the R1\u2013R3 years were identical to and were meant to occur within a DR residency. In the new DR curriculum, the R4 year is intended to allow residents to focus training in areas of interest (9). In the IR/DR proposal, most of this year was applied toward IR training, while the entire R5 year was dedicated to IR.The final proposal was also designed to allow a gradual introduction of this new program, as it was recognized that the seemingly small change from 4-1 to 3-2 was actually substantial. As the proposal was presented to the ABMS, both VIR fellowships and the new residencies leading to an IR/DR certificate would have coexisted, although the ABR was clear that this would not be continued indefinitely. However, the proposal did not provide any concrete end date for the VIR fellowships.The proposal was submitted to the ABMS in the spring of 2012 and was approved in September of that year. During the approval process, the ABMS mandated that a timeline be developed for the transition from VIR fellowship to the new residency (7). The proposal then moved to the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and was approved first by the radiology Residency Review Committee (RRC) and then by the ACGME board of directors in February, 2013. The residency and the writing of the program requirements were assigned to the radiology RRC. A committee was assembled to compose the requirements under the careful guidance of Jeanne Laberge, MD. This committee included representation by key DR stakeholders, and each detail was carefully vetted in terms of overall feasibility, impact on DR residents and programs, fulfillment of training goals in DR, and fulfillment of training goals in IR. The program requirements were posted for public comment on May 19, 2014 (10). There are some differences between the original proposal and the actual program requirements, largely as a result of careful vetting of issues among DR stakeholders, but in principle it remains a 3-2 training program. The ACGME has named the training that leads to an IR/DR certificate the \u201cIR residency.\u201dConcerns about this new IR/DR certificate can be grouped into four basic categories: the process of getting to the new certificate, the rationale for the change, programmatic challenges, and implications for further structural changes in radiology (2). The main process issue is the mandate by the ABMS to phase out VIR fellowships as the new training programs are phased in. As noted above, the proposal presented to the ABMS, with wide endorsement by DR stakeholders, would have allowed the VIR fellowships and IR residencies to exist in parallel. The member boards of the ABMS would not permit this situation to exist indefinitely for two reasons: First, they believed that there should not be two different certificates offered by one board for a single discipline. This would confuse the public. Second, and of overarching importance, all of the member boards of the ABMS viewed the changes in training leading to an IR/DR certificate to be in the best interest of patients, and therefore wanted a scheduled rather than an indefinite transition. The mandate to ultimately convert all VIR fellowships to IR residencies represents the highest endorsement of this proposal by all of organized medicine.This transition was never intended to be abrupt, nor could it be, as the lengths of training in DR and IR are changed for these residents. In addition, each VIR fellowship that converts to an IR residency has to be formally accredited by the radiology RRC, a process that is anticipated to take 6 or 7 years at a minimum (7). During this time, the ABR will continue to examine graduates of VIR fellowships, and it is designing processes for converting VIR subspecialty certificates to IR/DR specialty certificates. DR and VIR programs will therefore have a considerable amount of time to plan and implement these changes. The SIR has constituted a task force and the APDR a committee to assist programs through this transition (11,12).The second category of concern is the rationale for this change. IR shares with DR competency in imaging and competency in image-guided procedures. However, the practice of IR requires certain additional skills and activities that are distinct from those of DR. In many cases, the IR physician conducts a physical examination and obtains a patient history separate from the performance of a procedure, independently formulates a plan of evaluation and treatment, performs that treatment, and provides follow-up care. The care of the patient requires assumption of longitudinal inpatient and outpatient patient management responsibilities by the IR physician. Nonprocedural care provided by IR physicians is real. Between 1998 and 2008, the number of Evaluation and Management codes submitted by IR physicians for Medicare beneficiaries per year increased 1200% (from 4210 to 54 726) (13). This likely underestimates the actual nonprocedural clinical activity, as younger patients, such as those with uterine fibroids and varicose veins, would not be captured in the Medicare claims data. One year of IR residency is no longer adequate training to provide this care.The third set of concerns is related to the programmatic changes involved in implementing a new residency. These include the adequacy of training in DR, the ability of medical students to be able to commit to IR while in medical school (or for DR residents to opt in later in training), jurisdictional challenges between DR and IR program directors, stress on the training resources, potential lack of commitment of IR residents to DR, and perhaps a negative impact on the overall number of DR faculty members needed to train residents. Most of these concerns are not new to the individuals who prepared the two ABMS proposals, nor to those who wrote the ACGME program requirements. In anticipation of these concerns, mechanisms to address them were devised and embedded in the program requirements. For example, the ACGME decided that two structures for the IR residencies\u2014integrated or independent\u2014were necessary. The integrated program provides 5 years of training (3 years in DR and 2 years in IR) in a single institution, whereas the independent program provides only the final 2 years of IR training. In integrated programs, residents enter from medical school or from a DR program in the same institution, while in independent programs, residents enter after completing a DR residency. These programs can coexist, so a program may accept residents at multiple time points. The draft program requirements carefully state that integrated programs can accept only transfers from within their own institution; otherwise, completion of a DR residency is required. However, the program requirements allow for a resident who has finished 4 years of DR, during which he or she completes sufficient rotations in IR or IR-related disciplines, to be credited for 1 year of the IR portion of the IR residency. In other words, residents can complete a DR residency in one institution and then matriculate to another for either 1 or 2 years of IR training on the basis of how much IR or IR-related training they had during DR residency. This provides a flexible structure that is very similar to the current paradigm while enhancing training in IR.In challenging the adequacy of the DR training encompassed in integrated programs that lead to the IR/DR certificate, the implication is that all DR programs consist of a uniformly defined and balanced program that leads to equal competence in all areas. The current DR training model requires conformity only during the R1\u2013R3 years leading up to the core examination. The DR R4 year is highly variable, such that residents may focus on one or more subspecialty areas (9). In fact, IR/DR certification requires completion of the exact same training during R1\u2013R3 and that residents pass the exact same ABR core examination (10). Although the R4 year is then heavily weighted toward IR, up to four DR rotations are allowed in addition to the ICU rotation. Furthermore, every IR procedure requires image interpretation before, during, and after procedures, so the resident\u2019s DR skill set will continue to grow. Finally, this particular concern does not apply to independent programs, which will require prior completion of a DR residency.Incorporated within the program requirements are specific tools to address jurisdictional issues, potential competition for resources, and other organizational challenges recognized by the writing group. These include, for integrated programs, recommending appointment of an associate or assistant program director from DR. This would effectively allow the DR program director to deploy the IR/DR candidates during R1\u2013R3 as if they were DR residents, thus maintaining adequate balance within the DR training program. The potential impact on DR training is further diminished if a department chooses to implement an independent rather than an integrated training program. In this scenario, the DR residency is completed in full before the IR residency is begun.The concern that residents slated for IR may not be as committed to their DR training is based on an interesting supposition: That there are two species of residents, those with a uniformly broad interest in DR and those who are more interested in IR. The reality is that residents are now encouraged to focus their training during R4 in areas of personal interest and are allowed to select specific areas in which to be tested in their final certifying examination. Few residents will seek equal levels of expertise in all DR subject areas during the R4 year. By design, all DR residents will finish training with the same core but different advanced DR skill sets.IR residents will highly value their DR training and competency. In practice, IR physicians rely heavily on fluoroscopy, ultrasonography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and, increasingly, molecular imaging. All must make treatment decisions, often in dynamic situations, on the basis of their own interpretations of imaging data. The majority will likely enter practices that will include some component of DR responsibilities. Furthermore, over time, some may choose to focus more on DR than IR.The suggestion that the IR/DR certificate, and therefore the IR residency, will potentially lead to fewer DR faculty assumes two things: That potential DR residents will be siphoned off by a new competing training program and that this training will occur in isolation from DR programs. These assumptions are wrong. The training that leads to the IR/DR certificate has more overlap with DR, rather than less, and will almost uniformly be conducted within DR departments under the DR chair (10).Many in DR have voiced the concern that allowing IR to become a specialty and develop a unique training program will eventually lead to complete separation of IR from DR and to the dismantlement of DR as other subspecialties follow suit. This would be unwise for IR, as imaging competency is our single greatest asset for patients and will only grow in importance as more procedures are developed and imaging becomes more complex. The SIR has clearly stated that the change in IR training is not intended as a first step in separating IR from DR, and it believes that IR should remain within the house of radiology (11). Patient care will be best when IR and DR work together, on the same team.The concern that other DR subspecialties will seek specialty status is best examined by reviewing the relevant ABMS definitions. A subspecialty is an area of knowledge, skill, and practice concentration that is generally regarded as within a larger general (primary) specialty domain (14). Therefore, additional training is often required to achieve this higher level of focused competency. This definition comfortably accommodates nearly all DR subspecialties. Specialty recognition confers primacy, in that a unique combination of skills and knowledge requires dedicated training resulting in competency that is substantially different from other spheres of practice (15). All specialties and subspecialties have regions of overlap, but within medicine the three components of IR (competency in imaging, image-guided procedures, and periprocedural patient care) have been recognized as a unique and substantial combination by all member boards of the ABMS. The likelihood that proponents of another DR subspecialty will desire to seek distinction for it as a primary specialty of medicine or that it will be recognized by other boards as such seems low.The IR/DR certificate and the IR residency have been pursued for decades in the belief that these changes would result in better care for patients. This was the paramount criterion used by the ABR, the ABMS, and ultimately the ACGME when deciding to approve the IR/DR certificate. As we go forward, the importance of continued open and frank dialogue cannot be overstated. There will be many concerns and issues to address in this process, but there is also great opportunity for IR, for DR, and most of all, for our patients.Received May 31, 2014; final version accepted June 20.See also the article by Heitkamp and Gunderman in this issue.References1.

We hypothesised that functional polymorphisms in CCR5 and CCL5 influence perivascular leukocyte infiltration, inflammation, axonal loss, and remyelination, and disease course. Therefore, we determined genotypes at four possibly functional polymorphisms in CCR5 and CCL5 for 637 patients and 92 brain donors with multiple sclerosis (MS). For a subset of 192 patients, MRI data were available. We found that low-producer allele CCL5\u2013403\u204eG was associated with reduced risk of severe axonal loss, whereas high-producer allele CCL5\u2013403\u204eA was associated with a worse clinical disease course measured by the MS Functional Composite Score and MS Severity Score. Low-producer allele CCR5+303\u204eG was associated with reduced T2 hyperintense and T1 hypointense lesion volumes on MRI, and high-producer allele CCR5+303\u204eA with early age at onset. Furthermore, low-producer allele CCR5\u039432 was associated with reduced T2 lesion volume, lower black hole ratio on MRI, and with a higher percentage of lesions with signs of remyelination, histopathologically. In summary, our multifaceted study supports the notion that polymorphisms in CCL5 and CCR5 modify the course of MS."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2896202491", "relevance_score": 259.2559, "publication_year": 2019, "title": "Will machine learning end the viability of radiology as a thriving medical specialty?", "cited_by_count": 51, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Artificial intelligence", "level": 1, "score": 0.74727714}, {"display_name": "Workflow", "level": 2, "score": 0.6892648}, {"display_name": "Machine learning", "level": 1, "score": 0.6204316}, {"display_name": "Specialty", "level": 2, "score": 0.5459796}, {"display_name": "Health care", "level": 2, "score": 0.4888853}, {"display_name": "Deep learning", "level": 2, "score": 0.46643236}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"There": [0], "have": [1, 56, 213], "been": [2], "tremendous": [3], "advances": [4, 46], "in": [5, 18, 47, 54, 69, 102], "artificial": [6], "intelligence": [7], "(AI)": [8], "and": [9, 35, 41, 64, 93, 120, 145, 178, 182, 215], "machine": [10, 70, 100, 128, 139, 154, 221], "learning": [11, 23, 101, 140, 155, 222], "(ML)": [12], "within": [13, 115], "the": [14, 19, 82, 85, 97, 110, 116, 163, 186, 217], "past": [15], "decade,": [16], "especially": [17], "application": [20], "of": [21, 52, 84, 99, 109, 127, 138, 165, 194, 208], "deep": [22], "to": [24, 72, 81, 134, 224, 228, 245], "various": [25], "challenges.": [26, 149], "These": [27], "include": [28], "advanced": [29], "competitive": [30], "games": [31], "(such": [32], "as": [33, 168], "Chess": [34], "Go),": [36], "self-driving": [37], "cars,": [38], "speech": [39], "recognition,": [40], "intelligent": [42], "personal": [43], "assistants.": [44], "Rapid": [45], "computer": [48, 61], "vision": [49], "for": [50, 230, 243], "recognition": [51], "objects": [53], "pictures": [55], "led": [57], "some": [58], "individuals,": [59], "including": [60], "science": [62], "experts": [63, 68], "health": [65, 146], "care": [66, 147, 229], "system": [67], "learning,": [71, 129], "make": [73], "predictions": [74], "that": [75, 104, 160, 191, 220], "ML": [76, 201], "algorithms": [77, 114], "will": [78, 105, 156, 161, 196, 237], "soon": [79], "lead": [80], "replacement": [83, 108], "radiologist.": [86], "However,": [87], "there": [88], "are": [89], "complex": [90], "technological,": [91], "regulatory,": [92], "medicolegal": [94], "obstacles": [95], "facing": [96], "implementation": [98], "radiology": [103, 236], "definitely": [106], "preclude": [107], "radiologist": [111], "by": [112, 200, 204], "these": [113], "next": [117], "two": [118], "decades": [119], "beyond.": [121], "While": [122], "not": [123, 199], "a": [124, 169, 205, 239], "comprehensive": [125], "review": [126], "this": [130, 234], "article": [131], "is": [132], "intended": [133], "highlight": [135], "specific": [136], "features": [137], "which": [141], "face": [142], "significant": [143], "technological": [144], "systems": [148], "Rather": [150], "than": [151], "replacing": [152], "radiologists,": [153], "provide": [157], "quantitative": [158], "tools": [159], "increase": [162, 171], "value": [164], "diagnostic": [166], "imaging": [167], "biomarker,": [170], "image": [172], "quality": [173], "with": [174], "decreased": [175], "acquisition": [176], "times,": [177], "improve": [179], "workflow,": [180], "communication,": [181], "patient": [183], "safety.": [184], "In": [185, 233], "foreseeable": [187], "future,": [188], "we": [189], "predict": [190], "today's": [192], "generation": [193], "radiologists": [195, 211], "be": [197], "replaced": [198], "algorithms,": [202], "but": [203], "new": [206], "breed": [207], "data": [209], "science-savvy": [210], "who": [212], "embraced": [214], "harnessed": [216], "incredible": [218], "potential": [219], "has": [223], "advance": [225], "our": [226, 231], "ability": [227], "patients.": [232], "way,": [235], "remain": [238], "viable": [240], "medical": [241], "specialty": [242], "years": [244], "come.": [246]}, "authors": ["Stephen Chan", "Eliot L.

These include advanced competitive games (such as Chess and Go), self-driving cars, speech recognition, and intelligent personal assistants. Rapid advances in computer vision for recognition of objects in pictures have led some individuals, including computer science experts and health care system experts in machine learning, to make predictions that ML algorithms will soon lead to the replacement of the radiologist. However, there are complex technological, regulatory, and medicolegal obstacles facing the implementation of machine learning in radiology that will definitely preclude replacement of the radiologist by these algorithms within the next two decades and beyond. While not a comprehensive review of machine learning, this article is intended to highlight specific features of machine learning which face significant technological and health care systems challenges. Rather than replacing radiologists, machine learning will provide quantitative tools that will increase the value of diagnostic imaging as a biomarker, increase image quality with decreased acquisition times, and improve workflow, communication, and patient safety. In the foreseeable future, we predict that today's generation of radiologists will be replaced not by ML algorithms, but by a new breed of data science-savvy radiologists who have embraced and harnessed the incredible potential that machine learning has to advance our ability to care for our patients. In this way, radiology will remain a viable medical specialty for years to come."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2062307922", "relevance_score": 245.65623, "publication_year": 2012, "title": "Radiologic-Pathologic Correlation of Pediatric and Adolescent Spinal Neoplasms: Part 2, Intradural Extramedullary Spinal Neoplasms", "cited_by_count": 51, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Differential diagnosis", "level": 2, "score": 0.644971}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.5857198}, {"display_name": "Neuroimaging", "level": 2, "score": 0.52920824}, {"display_name": "Pathology", "level": 1, "score": 0.25514495}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"The": [0, 22], "purpose": [1], "of": [2, 11, 39, 50, 68, 71, 80], "this": [3, 28, 59], "article": [4, 43], "is": [5, 30], "to": [6, 94, 100], "review": [7], "the": [8, 17, 45, 61, 69, 76, 81, 84], "neuroimaging": [9], "findings": [10, 49], "intradural": [12, 54, 78], "extramedullary": [13, 55, 77], "spinal": [14], "tumors": [15], "in": [16, 27, 83], "pediatric": [18, 51, 85], "and": [19, 32, 47, 52, 86, 90], "adolescent": [20, 53, 87], "population.": [21], "differential": [23, 97], "diagnosis": [24, 98], "for": [25], "lesions": [26], "location": [29], "limited": [31], "can": [33], "be": [34, 92], "further": [35], "narrowed": [36], "with": [37], "knowledge": [38], "specific": [40], "imaging": [41, 101], "characteristics.This": [42], "reviews": [44], "radiologic": [46], "pathologic": [48], "neoplasms.": [56], "After": [57], "completing": [58], "article,": [60], "reader": [62], "should": [63, 91], "have": [64], "an": [65], "improved": [66], "understanding": [67], "types": [70], "neoplastic": [72], "processes": [73], "that": [74], "involve": [75], "compartment": [79], "spine": [82], "age": [88], "groups": [89], "able": [93], "narrow": [95], "their": [96], "according": [99], "findings.": [102]}, "authors": ["Karl A.

Methods Aggregated claims data for temporary central venous catheter and long-term CVA device (CVAD) procedures were extracted from Medicare Physician/Supplier Procedure Summary Master Files from 1992 through 2011. Central venous catheter and CVAD procedure volumes by specialty group and place of service were studied. Results Between 1992 and 2011, temporary and long-term CVA placement procedures increased from 638,703 to 808,071 (+27%) and from 76,444 to 316,042 (+313%), respectively. For temporary central venous catheters, radiology (from 0.4% in 1992 to 32.6% in 2011) now exceeds anesthesiology (from 37% to 22%) and surgery (from 30.4% to 11.7%) as the dominant provider group. Surgery continues to dominate in placement and explantation of long-term CVADs (from 80.7% to 50.4% and from 81.6% to 47.7%, respectively), but radiology's share has grown enormously (from 0.7% to 37.6% and from 0.2% to 28.6%). Although volumes remain small (<10% of all procedures), midlevel practitioners have experienced >100-fold growth for most services. The inpatient hospital remains the dominant site for temporary CVA procedures (90.0% in 1992 and 81.2% in 2011), but the placement of long-term CVADs has shifted from the inpatient (from 68.9% to 45.2%) to hospital outpatient (from 26.9% to 44.3%) setting. In all hospital settings combined, radiologists place approximately half of all tunneled catheters and three-quarters all peripherally inserted central catheters. Conclusions Over the past 2 decades, CVA procedures on Medicare beneficiaries have increased considerably. Radiology is now the dominant overall provider.

Because only 21.4% of medical schools require radiology clerkships, most students do not understand the indications for and clinical effectiveness of most imaging tests. Therefore, the authors introduced two focused sessions on evidence-based imaging during the required radiology core clerkship at their institution.From June 2008 to September 2009, 259 students in the radiology core clerkship participated in a didactic session on principles of evidence-based imaging and/or a small-group session and self-directed learning exercise using the American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria. Students evaluated the exercise on a five-point scale for its effectiveness in teaching imaging strategies and its impact on their future careers.Two hundred twenty-eight of 259 students (88%; 93 third year, 135 fourth year) participated in the two sessions. Two hundred thirteen of 223 (96%) were not aware of the ACR's Web site as a resource prior to this exercise. Two hundred fourteen of 228 (94%) found the ACR Appropriateness Criteria a useful resource. Two hundred two of 228 (89%) stated that they would likely use this resource in other clinical rotations and future practice. Two hundred three of 228 (89%) reported having a solid understanding of the indications for imaging tests following the sessions. Students praised the ACR's Web site for its comprehensive coverage of different modalities and their relative radiation risks. They valued working collaboratively on common clinical scenarios.The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are a valuable resource for teaching evidence-based imaging to medical students.

to distinguish between brain radiation necrosis (BRN) and tumor progression (TP).We divided diagnostic approaches into two categories as follows-conventional radiological imaging [computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): review question (RQ) 1] and nuclear medicine studies [single photon emission CT (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET): RQ2]-and queried. Our librarians conducted a comprehensive systematic search on PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and the Japan Medical Abstracts Society up to March 2015. We estimated summary statistics using the bivariate random effects model and performed subanalysis by dividing into tumor types-gliomas and metastatic brain tumors.Of 188 and 239 records extracted from the database, we included 20 and 26 studies in the analysis for RQ1 and RQ2, respectively. In RQ1, we used gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced MRI, diffusion-weighted image, MR spectroscopy, and perfusion CT/MRI to diagnose BRN in RQ1. In RQ2, 201Tl-, 99mTc-MIBI-, and 99mTc-GHA-SPECT, and 18F-FDG-, 11C-MET-, 18F-FET-, and 18F-BPA-PET were used. In meta-analysis, Gd-enhanced MRI exhibited the lowest sensitivity [63%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 28-89%] and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and combined multiple imaging studies displayed the highest sensitivity (96%; 95% CI: 83-99%) and DOR among all imaging studies. In subanalysis for gliomas, Gd-enhanced MRI and 18F-FDG-PET revealed low DOR. Conversely, we observed no difference in DOR among radiological imaging in metastatic brain tumors. However, diagnostic parameters and study subjects often differed among the same imaging studies. All studies enrolled a small number of patients, and only 10 were prospective studies without randomization.Differentiating BRN from TP using Gd-enhanced MRI and 18F-FDG-PET is challenging for patients with glioma. Conversely, BRN could be diagnosed by any radiological imaging in metastatic brain tumors. This review suggests that combined multiparametric imaging, including lesional metabolism and blood flow, could enhance diagnostic accuracy, compared with a single imaging study. Nevertheless, a substantial risk of bias and indirectness of reviewed studies hindered drawing firm conclusion about the best imaging technique for diagnosing BRN."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W1989792006", "relevance_score": 314.38147, "publication_year": 2002, "title": "Evidence-Based Radiology", "cited_by_count": 50, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Data access", "level": 2, "score": 0.45828408}, {"display_name": "Evidence-based medicine", "level": 3, "score": 0.4128917}, {"display_name": "Data science", "level": 1, "score": 0.3901438}, {"display_name": "Medical physics", "level": 1, "score": 0.38344514}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"The": [0], "purpose": [1], "of": [2, 35, 55, 87, 119, 147, 159], "this": [3, 59], "study": [4], "was": [5, 25, 64], "to": [6, 31, 46, 49, 66, 89, 113, 134, 144, 164], "determine": [7, 32], "the": [8, 33, 53, 62, 117, 145], "electronic": [9], "requirements": [10], "for": [11, 27], "supporting": [12, 78, 128], "evidence-based": [13, 41, 68, 79, 129, 136], "radiology": [14, 80, 137], "in": [15, 40, 116, 162], "today's": [16], "medical": [17, 125], "environment.A": [18], "software": [19], "engineering": [20], "technique,": [21], "use": [22, 34], "case": [23], "modeling,": [24], "performed": [26], "several": [28], "clinical": [29, 56, 91, 148], "settings": [30], "imaging": [36], "and": [37, 52, 71, 102, 108, 123, 157], "its": [38], "role": [39], "practice,": [42], "with": [43], "particular": [44], "attention": [45], "issues": [47, 142], "relating": [48], "data": [50, 92, 97, 149, 161], "access": [51, 88, 112, 156], "usage": [54], "information.": [57], "From": [58], "basic": [60], "understanding,": [61], "analysis": [63, 73], "extended": [65], "encompass": [67], "radiologic": [69, 106, 166], "research": [70], "teaching.The": [72], "showed": [74], "that": [75, 95, 132], "a": [76, 84], "system": [77], "must": [81, 140, 154], "(a)": [82], "provide": [83, 110], "single": [85], "point": [86], "multiple": [90], "sources": [93], "so": [94], "patient": [96, 121, 160], "can": [98], "be": [99], "readily": [100], "used": [101], "incorporated": [103], "into": [104], "comprehensive": [105], "consults": [107], "(b)": [109], "quick": [111], "external": [114], "evidence": [115], "way": [118], "similar": [120], "cases": [122], "published": [124], "literature,": [126], "thus": [127], "practice.Information": [130], "infrastructures": [131], "aim": [133], "support": [135], "not": [138], "only": [139], "address": [141], "related": [143], "integration": [146], "from": [150], "heterogeneous": [151], "databases,": [152], "but": [153], "facilitate": [155], "filtering": [158], "order": [163], "improve": [165], "consultation.": [167]}, "authors": ["Alex A.

From this basic understanding, the analysis was extended to encompass evidence-based radiologic research and teaching.The analysis showed that a system supporting evidence-based radiology must (a) provide a single point of access to multiple clinical data sources so that patient data can be readily used and incorporated into comprehensive radiologic consults and (b) provide quick access to external evidence in the way of similar patient cases and published medical literature, thus supporting evidence-based practice.Information infrastructures that aim to support evidence-based radiology not only must address issues related to the integration of clinical data from heterogeneous databases, but must facilitate access and filtering of patient data in order to improve radiologic consultation."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2099273373", "relevance_score": 297.17453, "publication_year": 2011, "title": "Radiation Protection in Pediatric Radiology", "cited_by_count": 50, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Ionizing radiation", "level": 3, "score": 0.7276388}, {"display_name": "Radiological weapon", "level": 2, "score": 0.56141675}, {"display_name": "Medical physics", "level": 1, "score": 0.5295219}, {"display_name": "Radiation protection", "level": 2, "score": 0.5075656}, {"display_name": "Radiation exposure", "level": 2, "score": 0.48403448}, {"display_name": "Non-ionizing radiation", "level": 2, "score": 0.4161046}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.34127265}, {"display_name": "Pediatrics", "level": 1, "score": 0.32123184}, {"display_name": "Nuclear medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.26019245}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"The": [0, 224], "German": [1], "Federal": [2], "Law": [3], "on": [4, 65, 77, 130, 139], "Radiation": [5], "Control": [6], "contains": [7], "no": [8], "special": [9, 107, 239], "provisions": [10], "for": [11, 63, 123, 147], "X-ray": [12, 156, 240], "studies": [13, 76, 157, 247], "in": [14, 29, 154, 227], "children": [15, 78, 214], "and": [16, 79, 102, 110, 119, 134, 173, 181, 193, 215, 253], "adolescents,": [17], "even": [18], "though": [19], "exposure": [20, 199, 212, 229], "to": [21, 44, 51, 69, 115, 120, 209, 217, 233], "ionizing": [22, 90, 152, 218, 249], "radiation": [23, 153, 198, 219, 250], "must": [24], "be": [25, 82], "kept": [26], "especially": [27], "low": [28], "young": [30], "persons,": [31], "because": [32], "their": [33], "tissues": [34], "are": [35, 46, 60, 113, 205, 230], "highly": [36], "radiosensitive.": [37], "Children,": [38], "who": [39], "have": [40], "many": [41, 207], "years": [42], "left": [43], "live,": [45], "more": [47], "likely": [48], "than": [49], "adults": [50], "develop": [52], "radiation-induced": [53, 66], "cancer;": [54], "also,": [55], "as": [56, 93, 142, 201, 203], "future": [57], "parents,": [58], "they": [59], "at": [61], "risk": [62], "passing": [64], "genetic": [67], "defects": [68], "the": [70, 116, 121, 124, 128, 140, 149, 159, 165, 189, 211, 236, 242, 254, 257], "next": [71], "generation.": [72], "Whenever": [73], "possible,": [74, 252], "radiological": [75], "adolescents": [80, 216], "should": [81], "of": [83, 151, 162, 167, 177, 191, 213, 238, 244, 256], "a": [84, 178, 182], "type": [85], "that": [86, 112], "does": [87], "not": [88], "involve": [89], "radiation,": [91], "such": [92], "ultrasonography": [94], "or": [95], "magnetic": [96], "resonance": [97], "imaging.": [98], "Pediatric": [99], "conventional": [100, 155], "X-rays": [101], "computerized": [103], "tomography": [104], "(CT)": [105], "require": [106], "examining": [108], "techniques": [109], "protocols": [111, 195], "adapted": [114], "patient's": [117], "age": [118], "indication": [122], "study.We": [125], "selectively": [126], "review": [127], "literature": [129], "pediatric": [131], "dose": [132, 150], "reduction": [133], "discuss": [135], "our": [136], "own": [137], "investigations": [138], "subject": [141], "well.The": [143], "essential": [144], "technical": [145], "prerequisites": [146], "lowering": [148, 228], "include": [158], "proper": [160, 231], "setting": [161], "tube": [163, 168], "voltage,": [164], "use": [166, 176, 190, 237, 243], "filters,": [169], "suitable": [170], "patient": [171], "positioning": [172], "fixation,": [174], "variable": [175], "scattered-radiation": [179], "grid,": [180], "modern": [183], "storage-plate": [184], "system.": [185], "In": [186], "CT": [187], "studies,": [188], "age-": [192], "indication-adapted": [194], "can": [196], "lower": [197, 210], "by": [200], "much": [202], "95%.There": [204], "now": [206], "ways": [208], "without": [220, 248], "sacrificing": [221], "diagnostic": [222], "reliability.": [223], "main": [225], "factors": [226], "attention": [232], "clinical": [234], "indications,": [235], "protocols,": [241], "alternative": [245], "imaging": [246], "wherever": [251], "expertise": [255], "examiner.": [258]}, "authors": ["G. Alzen", "G.

Children, who have many years left to live, are more likely than adults to develop radiation-induced cancer; also, as future parents, they are at risk for passing on radiation-induced genetic defects to the next generation. Whenever possible, radiological studies on children and adolescents should be of a type that does not involve ionizing radiation, such as ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging. Pediatric conventional X-rays and computerized tomography (CT) require special examining techniques and protocols that are adapted to the patient's age and to the indication for the study.We selectively review the literature on pediatric dose reduction and discuss our own investigations on the subject as well.The essential technical prerequisites for lowering the dose of ionizing radiation in conventional X-ray studies include the proper setting of tube voltage, the use of tube filters, suitable patient positioning and fixation, variable use of a scattered-radiation grid, and a modern storage-plate system. In CT studies, the use of age- and indication-adapted protocols can lower radiation exposure by as much as 95%.There are now many ways to lower the exposure of children and adolescents to ionizing radiation without sacrificing diagnostic reliability. The main factors in lowering exposure are proper attention to clinical indications, the use of special X-ray protocols, the use of alternative imaging studies without ionizing radiation wherever possible, and the expertise of the examiner."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2164522962", "relevance_score": 259.78653, "publication_year": 2015, "title": "Trends in Lumbar Puncture Over 2 Decades: A Dramatic Shift to Radiology", "cited_by_count": 50, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Specialty", "level": 2, "score": 0.69945335}, {"display_name": "Emergency department", "level": 2, "score": 0.4234131}, {"display_name": "Medicare Part B", "level": 3, "score": 0.4114321}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.34155378}, {"display_name": "Family medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.28987086}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"The": [0, 189], "purpose": [1], "of": [2, 19, 52, 62, 99, 154, 176, 197], "this": [3, 23, 242], "study": [4], "is": [5], "to": [6, 262], "evaluate": [7], "national": [8], "trends": [9], "in": [10, 70, 81, 88, 103, 111, 121, 128, 161, 168, 200, 204, 211, 216, 220, 253, 271, 274], "lumbar": [11], "puncture": [12], "(LP)": [13], "procedures": [14, 64, 73, 84, 102, 156, 209, 228], "and": [15, 50, 57, 77, 123, 135, 163], "the": [16, 59, 139, 150, 194, 212, 223, 237, 260], "relative": [17], "roles": [18], "specialty": [20, 48], "groups": [21], "providing": [22], "service.Aggregated": [24], "claims": [25], "data": [26], "for": [27, 186, 250], "LPs": [28], "were": [29, 54], "extracted": [30], "from": [31, 40], "Medicare": [32, 89, 230], "Physician": [33], "Supplier": [34], "Procedure": [35], "Summary": [36], "master": [37], "files": [38], "annually": [39], "1991": [41, 56, 122, 162, 201, 217], "through": [42, 268], "2011.": [43, 112], "LP": [44, 63, 72, 83, 101, 145, 155, 227], "procedure": [45], "volumes": [46, 171], "by": [47, 208], "group": [49], "place": [51], "service": [53, 198], "studied.Between": [55], "2011,": [58], "overall": [60, 239], "numbers": [61], "increased,": [65, 233], "with": [66, 234], "a": [67, 78], "slight": [68], "increase": [69, 80], "diagnostic": [71, 114], "(90,460": [74], "vs": [75, 86, 202, 218], "90,785)": [76], "marked": [79], "therapeutic": [82, 144], "(2868": [85], "6461)": [87], "fee-for-service": [90, 255], "beneficiaries.": [91], "Although": [92, 170, 241], "radiologists": [93], "performed": [94, 106, 210], "11.3%": [95], "(n": [96, 108], "=": [97, 109, 119, 126, 159, 166], "10,533)": [98], "all": [100, 136, 177], "1991,": [104], "they": [105], "46.6%": [107], "45,338)": [110], "For": [113, 143], "LPs,": [115], "radiology": [116, 147, 235, 251], "(11.4%": [117], "[n": [118, 125, 158, 165], "10,272]": [120], "48.0%": [124], "43,601]": [127], "2011)": [129], "now": [130, 148, 236], "exceeds": [131], "emergency": [132, 213], "medicine,": [133], "neurosciences,": [134], "others": [137], "as": [138], "dominant": [140, 195, 238], "provider": [141], "group.": [142], "procedures,": [146], "performs": [149], "second": [151], "greatest": [152], "number": [153], "(9.0%": [157], "261]": [160], "26.9%": [164], "1737]": [167], "2011).": [169], "remain": [172], "small": [173], "(<": [174], "10%": [175], "procedures),": [178], "midlevel": [179], "practitioners": [180], "have": [181, 232, 245], "experienced": [182], "over": [183], "100-fold": [184], "growth": [185], "most": [187], "services.": [188], "inpatient": [190], "hospital": [191], "setting": [192], "remains": [193], "site": [196], "(71,385": [199], "44,817": [203], "2011:": [205, 221], "-37%),": [206], "followed": [207], "department": [214], "(297": [215], "26,117": [219], "8794%).Over": [222], "last": [224], "2": [225], "decades,": [226], "on": [229], "beneficiaries": [231], "provider.": [240], "trend": [243], "may": [244], "relatively": [246], "negative": [247], "financial": [248], "implications": [249], "practices": [252], "current": [254], "payment": [256], "models,": [257], "it": [258], "has": [259], "potential": [261], "cement": [263], "radiology's": [264], "more": [265], "central": [266], "position": [267], "direct": [269], "involvement": [270], "patient": [272], "care": [273, 277], "emerging": [275], "accountable": [276], "organizations.": [278]}, "authors": ["Hannes Kroll", "Richard Duszak", "Eugene Nsiah", "Danny R.

LP procedure volumes by specialty group and place of service were studied.Between 1991 and 2011, the overall numbers of LP procedures increased, with a slight increase in diagnostic LP procedures (90,460 vs 90,785) and a marked increase in therapeutic LP procedures (2868 vs 6461) in Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries. Although radiologists performed 11.3% (n = 10,533) of all LP procedures in 1991, they performed 46.6% (n = 45,338) in 2011. For diagnostic LPs, radiology (11.4% [n = 10,272] in 1991 and 48.0% [n = 43,601] in 2011) now exceeds emergency medicine, neurosciences, and all others as the dominant provider group. For therapeutic LP procedures, radiology now performs the second greatest number of LP procedures (9.0% [n = 261] in 1991 and 26.9% [n = 1737] in 2011). Although volumes remain small (< 10% of all procedures), midlevel practitioners have experienced over 100-fold growth for most services. The inpatient hospital setting remains the dominant site of service (71,385 in 1991 vs 44,817 in 2011: -37%), followed by procedures performed in the emergency department (297 in 1991 vs 26,117 in 2011: 8794%).Over the last 2 decades, LP procedures on Medicare beneficiaries have increased, with radiology now the dominant overall provider. Although this trend may have relatively negative financial implications for radiology practices in current fee-for-service payment models, it has the potential to cement radiology's more central position through direct involvement in patient care in emerging accountable care organizations."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2977514150", "relevance_score": 250.91536, "publication_year": 2019, "title": "Ethics of artificial intelligence in radiology: summary of the joint European and North American multisociety statement", "cited_by_count": 50, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Transparency (behavior)", "level": 2, "score": 0.5111831}, {"display_name": "Interventional radiology", "level": 2, "score": 0.47369647}, {"display_name": "Dignity", "level": 2, "score": 0.46761024}, {"display_name": "Informatics", "level": 2, "score": 0.45798814}, {"display_name": "Accountability", "level": 2, "score": 0.45591933}, {"display_name": "Neuroradiology", "level": 3, "score": 0.42287886}, {"display_name": "Ethical code", "level": 2, "score": 0.4199741}, {"display_name": "Engineering ethics", "level": 1, "score": 0.3549242}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.34762168}, {"display_name": "Public relations", "level": 1, "score": 0.21869105}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Abstract": [0], "This": [1, 124], "is": [2, 98, 112], "a": [3, 153], "condensed": [4], "summary": [5], "of": [6, 13, 25, 36, 42, 47, 71, 83, 132, 204, 225], "an": [7], "international": [8], "multisociety": [9], "statement": [10, 125], "on": [11], "ethics": [12, 205], "artificial": [14], "intelligence": [15], "(AI)": [16], "in": [17, 32, 49, 77, 106, 121, 134, 152], "radiology": [18, 78, 135, 196, 226], "produced": [19], "by": [20], "the": [21, 81, 144, 192, 218], "ACR,": [22], "European": [23, 34], "Society": [24, 28, 35], "Radiology,": [26], "RSNA,": [27], "for": [29, 103, 173, 182, 191, 208, 230], "Imaging": [30, 38], "Informatics": [31], "Medicine,": [33], "Medical": [37], "Informatics,": [39], "Canadian": [40], "Association": [41, 46], "Radiologists,": [43], "and": [44, 58, 67, 74, 89, 93, 141, 146, 163, 167, 176, 180, 189, 206, 217, 221, 228], "American": [45], "Physicists": [48], "Medicine.": [50], "AI": [51, 102, 120, 133, 158, 183, 209], "has": [52], "great": [53], "potential": [54], "to": [55, 114, 117, 201], "increase": [56, 80], "efficiency": [57], "accuracy": [59], "throughout": [60], "radiology,": [61], "but": [62], "also": [63], "carries": [64], "inherent": [65], "pitfalls": [66], "biases.": [68], "Widespread": [69], "use": [70, 131, 213, 224], "AI-based": [72], "intelligent": [73], "autonomous": [75], "systems": [76], "can": [79], "risk": [82], "systemic": [84], "errors": [85], "with": [86, 185], "high": [87], "consequence,": [88], "highlights": [90, 126], "complex": [91], "ethical": [92, 130], "societal": [94], "issues.": [95], "Currently,": [96], "there": [97], "little": [99], "experience": [100], "using": [101], "patient": [104], "care": [105], "diverse": [107], "clinical": [108, 122], "settings.": [109], "Extensive": [110], "research": [111], "needed": [113], "understand": [115], "how": [116], "best": [118], "deploy": [119], "practice.": [123], "our": [127], "consensus": [128], "that": [129, 143, 214], "should": [136, 159, 170, 198, 222], "promote": [137, 211], "well-being,": [138], "minimize": [139], "harm,": [140], "ensure": [142], "benefits": [145], "harms": [147], "are": [148], "distributed": [149], "among": [150], "stakeholders": [151], "just": [154], "manner.": [155], "We": [156], "believe": [157], "respect": [160], "human": [161, 187], "rights": [162], "freedoms,": [164], "including": [165], "dignity": [166], "privacy.": [168], "It": [169], "be": [171], "designed": [172], "maximum": [174], "transparency": [175], "dependability.": [177], "Ultimate": [178], "responsibility": [179], "accountability": [181], "remains": [184], "its": [186], "designers": [188], "operators": [190], "foreseeable": [193], "future.": [194], "The": [195], "community": [197], "start": [199], "now": [200], "develop": [202], "codes": [203], "practice": [207], "which": [210], "any": [212], "helps": [215], "patients": [216], "common": [219], "good": [220], "block": [223], "data": [227], "algorithms": [229], "financial": [231], "gain": [232], "without": [233], "those": [234], "two": [235], "attributes.": [236]}, "authors": ["J.

AI has great potential to increase efficiency and accuracy throughout radiology, but also carries inherent pitfalls and biases. Widespread use of AI-based intelligent and autonomous systems in radiology can increase the risk of systemic errors with high consequence, and highlights complex ethical and societal issues. Currently, there is little experience using AI for patient care in diverse clinical settings. Extensive research is needed to understand how to best deploy AI in clinical practice. This statement highlights our consensus that ethical use of AI in radiology should promote well-being, minimize harm, and ensure that the benefits and harms are distributed among stakeholders in a just manner. We believe AI should respect human rights and freedoms, including dignity and privacy. It should be designed for maximum transparency and dependability. Ultimate responsibility and accountability for AI remains with its human designers and operators for the foreseeable future. The radiology community should start now to develop codes of ethics and practice for AI which promote any use that helps patients and the common good and should block use of radiology data and algorithms for financial gain without those two attributes."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W1967538951", "relevance_score": 247.9903, "publication_year": 2011, "title": "Identifying Benchmarks for Discrepancy Rates in Preliminary Interpretations Provided by Radiology Trainees at an Academic Institution", "cited_by_count": 50, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Turnaround time", "level": 2, "score": 0.63988066}, {"display_name": "Emergency department", "level": 2, "score": 0.62369114}, {"display_name": "Medical physics", "level": 1, "score": 0.5361035}, {"display_name": "Modalities", "level": 2, "score": 0.51127267}, {"display_name": "Academic institution", "level": 2, "score": 0.5016353}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.4402629}, {"display_name": "Patient care", "level": 2, "score": 0.43142933}, {"display_name": "Benchmark (surveying)", "level": 2, "score": 0.41913474}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"At": [0], "many": [1], "academic": [2], "medical": [3], "centers,": [4], "radiology": [5, 238], "house": [6], "staff": [7], "provide": [8, 45], "preliminary": [9, 30, 133, 235], "interpretations": [10, 31, 236], "for": [11, 48, 61, 123, 174, 179, 197, 204, 218, 228, 245], "imaging": [12, 220], "studies": [13, 221], "after": [14], "hours,": [15], "the": [16, 73, 165, 180, 198, 224], "accuracy": [17], "and": [18, 159, 178, 188, 232, 247], "timely": [19], "availability": [20], "of": [21, 41, 53, 110, 129, 131, 140, 161, 167, 182, 212, 234], "which": [22], "are": [23, 32], "crucial": [24], "to": [25, 57, 85, 119, 156], "patient": [26], "care.": [27], "Nevertheless,": [28], "these": [29], "sometimes": [33], "discrepant": [34, 96], "with": [35, 97], "finalized": [36], "attending": [37, 101], "reports.": [38], "The": [39, 51, 106, 147, 191], "rate": [40, 176], "such": [42], "discrepancies": [43], "can": [44], "valuable": [46, 242], "information": [47], "quality": [49, 249], "improvement.": [50, 250], "aim": [52], "this": [54], "study": [55], "was": [56, 83, 113, 194], "identify": [58, 120], "specific": [59, 121], "benchmarks": [60, 122, 171, 227], "resident": [62, 124, 162], "discrepancy": [63, 149, 170, 230], "rates": [64, 150, 231], "by": [65, 138, 237], "reviewing": [66], "all": [67, 87, 111, 219], "73,072": [68, 132], "on-call": [69, 88], "reports": [70, 89, 112], "generated": [71, 90], "at": [72], "authors'": [74], "institution": [75], "over": [76], "1": [77, 213], "year.A": [78], "custom-built": [79], "interface": [80], "called": [81], "Orion": [82], "used": [84, 118], "track": [86], "in": [91], "2010.": [92], "Reports": [93], "graded": [94], "as": [95], "major": [98, 145, 148, 169, 229], "changes": [99], "during": [100], "review": [102], "were": [103, 117, 136, 172], "automatically": [104], "identified.": [105], "turnaround": [107], "time": [108], "(TAT)": [109], "measured.": [114], "These": [115], "data": [116], "performance": [125], "on": [126], "call.A": [127], "total": [128], "45,608": [130], "dictations": [134], "(62%)": [135], "interpreted": [137], "residents;": [139], "these,": [141], "407": [142], "(0.89%)": [143], "had": [144], "discrepancies.": [146], "varied": [151], "among": [152], "individual": [153, 246], "residents": [154], "(0.2%": [155], "1.8%),": [157], "modalities,": [158], "level": [160], "training.": [163], "On": [164], "basis": [166], "distributions,": [168], "established": [173], "overall": [175], "(1.7%)": [177], "modalities": [181], "conventional": [183], "radiography": [184], "(1.5%),": [185], "CT": [186], "(4.0%),": [187], "ultrasound": [189], "(4.0%).": [190], "mean": [192], "TAT": [193, 211, 233], "significantly": [195], "shorter": [196], "emergency": [199, 225], "department": [200], "(46": [201], "minutes)": [202], "than": [203], "inpatient": [205], "services": [206], "(144": [207], "minutes).": [208], "A": [209], "benchmark": [210], "hour": [214], "has": [215], "been": [216], "adopted": [217], "performed": [222], "through": [223], "department.Identifying": [226], "trainees": [239], "is": [240], "a": [241], "first": [243], "step": [244], "departmental": [248]}, "authors": ["Alexander T.

Nevertheless, these preliminary interpretations are sometimes discrepant with finalized attending reports. The rate of such discrepancies can provide valuable information for quality improvement. The aim of this study was to identify specific benchmarks for resident discrepancy rates by reviewing all 73,072 on-call reports generated at the authors' institution over 1 year.A custom-built interface called Orion was used to track all on-call reports generated in 2010. Reports graded as discrepant with major changes during attending review were automatically identified. The turnaround time (TAT) of all reports was measured. These data were used to identify specific benchmarks for resident performance on call.A total of 45,608 of 73,072 preliminary dictations (62%) were interpreted by residents; of these, 407 (0.89%) had major discrepancies. The major discrepancy rates varied among individual residents (0.2% to 1.8%), modalities, and level of resident training. On the basis of distributions, major discrepancy benchmarks were established for overall rate (1.7%) and for the modalities of conventional radiography (1.5%), CT (4.0%), and ultrasound (4.0%). The mean TAT was significantly shorter for the emergency department (46 minutes) than for inpatient services (144 minutes). A benchmark TAT of 1 hour has been adopted for all imaging studies performed through the emergency department.Identifying benchmarks for major discrepancy rates and TAT of preliminary interpretations by radiology trainees is a valuable first step for individual and departmental quality improvement."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W1930022747", "relevance_score": 246.2131, "publication_year": 2016, "title": "Imaging in the Age of Precision Medicine: Summary of the Proceedings of the 10th Biannual Symposium of the International Society for Strategic Studies in Radiology", "cited_by_count": 50, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Reimbursement", "level": 3, "score": 0.68130267}, {"display_name": "Radiogenomics", "level": 3, "score": 0.67387277}, {"display_name": "Precision medicine", "level": 2, "score": 0.53072584}, {"display_name": "Health care", "level": 2, "score": 0.52169555}, {"display_name": "Psychological intervention", "level": 2, "score": 0.4748811}, {"display_name": "Reductionism", "level": 2, "score": 0.46769476}, {"display_name": "Medical physics", "level": 1, "score": 0.40103203}, {"display_name": "Pathology", "level": 1, "score": 0.26506877}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"During": [0], "the": [1, 91, 120, 137, 181, 184, 193, 199, 203, 210, 216], "past": [2], "decade,": [3], "with": [4, 202], "its": [5], "breakthroughs": [6], "in": [7, 25, 42, 54, 90, 178, 190], "systems": [8], "biology,": [9], "precision": [10], "medicine": [11], "(PM)": [12], "has": [13], "emerged": [14], "as": [15], "a": [16, 55, 60], "novel": [17], "health-care": [18], "paradigm.": [19], "Challenging": [20], "reductionism": [21], "and": [22, 34, 45, 65, 71, 78, 81, 123, 154, 159, 168, 195, 212], "broad-based": [23], "approaches": [24], "medicine,": [26], "PM": [27], "is": [28], "an": [29], "approach": [30], "for": [31, 94, 142, 187, 198], "disease": [32, 107], "treatment": [33], "prevention": [35], "that": [36], "takes": [37], "into": [38], "account": [39], "individual": [40], "variability": [41], "genes,": [43], "environment,": [44], "lifestyle.": [46], "It": [47], "involves": [48], "integrating": [49], "information": [50, 80, 104], "from": [51], "multiple": [52], "sources": [53], "holistic": [56], "manner": [57], "to": [58, 105, 115, 133, 165, 205], "achieve": [59], "definitive": [61], "diagnosis,": [62], "focused": [63], "treatment,": [64], "adequate": [66], "response": [67], "assessment.": [68], "Biomedical": [69], "imaging": [70, 126, 200], "imaging-guided": [72], "interventions,": [73], "which": [74, 101, 175], "provide": [75], "multiparametric": [76], "morphologic": [77], "functional": [79], "enable": [82], "focused,": [83], "minimally": [84], "invasive": [85], "treatments,": [86], "are": [87], "key": [88], "elements": [89], "infrastructure": [92], "needed": [93], "PM.": [95, 206], "The": [96], "emerging": [97], "discipline": [98], "of": [99, 119, 125, 151, 183, 215], "radiogenomics,": [100], "links": [102], "genotypic": [103], "phenotypic": [106], "manifestations": [108], "at": [109], "imaging,": [110], "should": [111], "also": [112], "greatly": [113], "contribute": [114], "patient-tailored": [116], "care.": [117], "Because": [118], "growing": [121], "volume": [122], "complexity": [124], "data,": [127], "decision-support": [128], "algorithms": [129], "will": [130, 147, 163], "be": [131, 166], "required": [132], "help": [134], "physicians": [135], "apply": [136], "most": [138], "essential": [139], "patient": [140], "data": [141], "optimal": [143], "management.": [144], "These": [145], "innovations": [146], "challenge": [148], "traditional": [149], "concepts": [150], "health": [152], "care": [153], "business": [155], "models.": [156], "Reimbursement": [157], "policies": [158], "quality": [160], "assurance": [161], "measures": [162], "have": [164], "reconsidered": [167], "adapted.": [169], "In": [170], "their": [171], "10th": [172], "biannual": [173], "symposium,": [174], "was": [176], "held": [177], "August": [179], "2013,": [180], "members": [182], "International": [185], "Society": [186], "Strategic": [188], "Studies": [189], "Radiology": [191], "discussed": [192], "opportunities": [194], "challenges": [196], "arising": [197], "community": [201], "transition": [204], "This": [207], "article": [208], "summarizes": [209], "discussions": [211], "central": [213], "messages": [214], "symposium.": [217]}, "authors": ["Christian Herold", "Jonathan S.

Challenging reductionism and broad-based approaches in medicine, PM is an approach for disease treatment and prevention that takes into account individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle. It involves integrating information from multiple sources in a holistic manner to achieve a definitive diagnosis, focused treatment, and adequate response assessment. Biomedical imaging and imaging-guided interventions, which provide multiparametric morphologic and functional information and enable focused, minimally invasive treatments, are key elements in the infrastructure needed for PM. The emerging discipline of radiogenomics, which links genotypic information to phenotypic disease manifestations at imaging, should also greatly contribute to patient-tailored care. Because of the growing volume and complexity of imaging data, decision-support algorithms will be required to help physicians apply the most essential patient data for optimal management. These innovations will challenge traditional concepts of health care and business models. Reimbursement policies and quality assurance measures will have to be reconsidered and adapted. In their 10th biannual symposium, which was held in August 2013, the members of the International Society for Strategic Studies in Radiology discussed the opportunities and challenges arising for the imaging community with the transition to PM.

In the diabetic group, there was correlation between the incidence of medial arterial calcification in the feet and the incidence of medial arterial calcification at the knee, but not with the incidence of intimal calcification at the knee. The incidence of arterial calcification in the feet of the diabetics bore a definite relationship to increasing patient age, sex (males being more affected), duration of the diabetes in the under\u2010fifty\u2010years age group, the presence of retinopathy and the incidence of gangrene. There was no correlation with the severity of, or control of, the diabetes. In a small group of non\u2010diabetic patients showing advanced arterial calcification in the feet, fasting blood sugar levels were slightly higher than in a control group, but response to a sugar load was similar.

High\u2010resolution manometry clearly identifies crural diaphragm and lower esophageal sphincter. Objectives To assess the diagnostic accuracy of high\u2010resolution manometry in detecting hiatal hernia compared to esophagogram and esophagogastroduodenoscopy, using as reference the surgical in vivo measurement. Methods Patients were studied with esophagogram, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, high\u2010resolution manometry and in vivo evaluation of the esophago\u2010gastric junction. Esophago\u2010gastric junction was classified as type I (no separation between crural diaphragm and lower esophageal sphincter); type II (\u22651, \u2264 2 cm separation); type III (&gt;2 cm). During in vivo measurement, distance between the esophago\u2010gastric junction and crural diaphragm proximal border was recorded. Results Surgery identified 53 hiatal hernias in 100 patients. Forty\u2010seven percent were classified as type I esophago\u2010gastric junction, 35% type II and 18% type III. Referenced to in vivo evaluation, high\u2010resolution manometry showed superior diagnostic sensitivity and specificity (94.3% and 91.5%, respectively) to esophagogram and esophagogastroduodenoscopy, with 92.6% predictive value of a positive test and 93.5% predictive value of a negative test. The kappa value for high\u2010resolution manometry and in vivo evaluation was 0.85. High\u2010resolution manometry showed optimal sensitivity and specificity in detecting types I, II and III esophago\u2010gastric junction.

Perception about what IR entails varied, with 52% of the students aware of IR involvement in major and potentially life-saving procedures; however, 34% believed that an interventional radiologist primarily performed \"minor\" procedures or \"read films.\" Previous interaction with interventional radiologists was uncommon. Following the single, case-based introductory IR lecture, 74% of the class was eager to learn more about the specialty, with 22% interested in enrolling in a dedicated hands-on elective in IR. The perception and impression of what IR entails changed significantly for the better for 75% of the students. Before the lecture, 19% were considering IR as a career (first or second choice); this increased to 33% after the introductory lecture.Although medical students are aware of IR, their exposure and understanding is limited. They are keen to learn more when exposed to it. Reaching out to the medical students early in their career may help in recruiting talent and securing the specialty's growth."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W4250345235", "relevance_score": 208.376,

CitationsTrack Citations ShareShare onFacebookTwitterLinked InEmail AboutAbstractDevelopments in nuclear physics and their practical applications since the last International Congress have greatly increased the number and scope of potential hazards. At the same time biological research has led to an extension of our knowledge of the dangers associated with ionizing radiations. This increase of biological knowledge has not only brought a realisation of the importance of certain effects, particularly carcinogenic and genetic effects, but has also provided more information as to the permissible levels of radiation. The International Commission on Radiological Protection has therefore adopted new radiation safety standards with more rigid criteria. Such standards must, in view of the still limited experience of the effects of radiation, be kept continually under review.It appears that the effects to be considered are:(1) Superficial injuries.(2) General effects on the body, particularly the blood and blood-forming organs, e.g., production of an\u00e6mia and leuk\u00e6mias.(3) The induction of malignant tumours.(4) Other deleterious effects including cataract, obesity, impaired fertility, and reduction of life span.(5) Genetic effects.While it is still fundamental to express whole-body exposure in terms of a single number, it is not practicable, in general, in view of the complexity of circumstances now arising, to express the maximum permissible now arising, to express the maximum permissible hazards in terms of a single parameter. It is, for example, highly desirable to derive values of maximum permissible concentrations of radioactive materials in the air or in drinking water, taking into account the metabolism of the materials concerned, and assuming standard anatomical, physiological, and chemical data.

Methods We identified desiderata of radiology data warehouses and designed and implemented a prototype system (RadBank) to meet these needs. RadBank was built with open-source software tools on a Linux platform with a relational database. We created a text report parsing module that recognizes the structure of radiology reports and makes individual sections available for indexing and search. A database schema was designed to link radiology and pathology reports and to enable users to retrieve cases using flexible queries. Results Our system contains more than 2 million radiology and pathology reports, and allows full text search by patient history, findings, and diagnosis by radiology and pathology. RadBank has helped radiologists at our institution find teaching cases and identify research cohorts. Conclusion Data warehouses can provide radiologists access to important clinical information contained in radiology and pathology reports, and supplement the image information in picture archiving and communication system workstations. We believe that data warehouses similar to our system can be implemented in other radiology departments within a reasonable budget to make their vast radiologic-pathologic case material accessible for education and research.

Objectives The purpose of this anatomical and radiologic study was to assess the value of anteroposterior, inlet, outlet, and lateral views with regard to the planning of iliosacral screw placement, to determine if screws penetrating the sacral surfaces and foramina can be detected during or after operation, and to evaluate the anatomy of the superior aspects of the sacral ala quantitatively. Summary of Background Data Direct iliosacral screw fixation has recently become popular because it provides stable fixation using reasonably small implants and is biomechanically equal or superior to other techniques of internal fixation. However, misinterpretation of the relationship of pelvic radiographs and the position of a screw may result in incorrect screw placement during surgery or misdiagnosis of postoperative neurologic complications. The morphology of the sacrum is complex. No previous data relative to the superior aspect of the sacral alae are available. Methods Four bony pelves were used to model the different iliosacral screw orientations possible during iliosacral reconstruction. A drill bit was inserted laterally from the posterior ilium through the sacroiliac joint and into the S1 vertebra. Radiographs were taken from anteroposterior, lateral, inlet, and outlet views for evaluation of placement. Twenty-two dry sacra were obtained for anatomic evaluation of the superior aspects of the sacral alae. All symmetrical structures were measured bilaterally. Measurements included three angular and two linear parameters. Results The results showed that a misdirected drill bit penetrating the anterior aspect of the ala is best appreciated by the inlet view. A misdirected drill bit penetrating the superior aspect of the ala or the S1 foramen is best represented in the outlet view. The average angle between the coronal plane of the S1 vertebra and the anterior aspect of the ala was 27.1\u00b0; between the superior aspect of the S1 vertebral body and superior edge of the ala, 36.9\u00b0; and between the superior aspect of the S1 vertebral body and posterosuperior edge of the ala, 24.5\u00b0. Conclusions The inlet view shows the orientation of screws relative to the coronal plane and extraosseus screws extending anterior to the ala, whereas the outlet view elucidates the placement of screws relative to the transverse plane and extraosseus screw tips extending into the sacral foramina or superior to the ala. Evaluation of preoperative pelvic computed tomography scans may be helpful in understanding the unique morphology of each individual patient and enhancing the safety of iliosacral screw placement."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W128682652", "relevance_score": 309.496, "publication_year": 1996, "title": "Radiology of peritoneal carcinomatosis", "cited_by_count": 49, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Pelvis", "level": 2, "score": 0.6930901}, {"display_name": "Carcinosis", "level": 5, "score": 0.68399155}, {"display_name": "Abdomen", "level": 2, "score": 0.6657103}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.64963657}, {"display_name": "Peritoneal carcinomatosis", "level": 4, "score": 0.6349815}, {"display_name": "Adenocarcinoma", "level": 3, "score": 0.5828491}, {"display_name": "Lymphatic system", "level": 2, "score": 0.48981568}, {"display_name": "Cancer", "level": 2, "score": 0.4705021}, {"display_name": "Peritoneal cavity", "level": 2, "score": 0.4249409}, {"display_name": "Mucinous Tumor", "level": 3, "score": 0.41530707}, {"display_name": "Pathology", "level": 1, "score": 0.32608408}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Radiologic": [0], "evaluation": [1], "of": [2, 28, 48, 57, 81, 111, 121, 128, 148, 150], "the": [3, 40, 51, 55, 90, 99, 108, 119], "liver,": [4], "lungs,": [5], "and": [6, 53, 114, 132, 137, 152], "retroperitoneum": [7], "to": [8, 17, 71, 106, 116], "detect": [9, 26], "primary": [10], "or": [11, 97, 160], "recurrent": [12], "cancer": [13, 82], "has": [14], "been": [15], "shown": [16], "achieve": [18], "great": [19], "accuracy.": [20], "Computed": [21], "tomography": [22], "(CT)": [23], "will": [24], "reliably": [25], "lesions": [27], "1": [29], "cm": [30], "diameter": [31], "in": [32, 74, 118, 155], "all": [33], "these": [34], "locations.": [35], "Special": [36], "studies": [37], "can": [38], "make": [39], "CT": [41, 58, 154], "even": [42], "more": [43], "sensitive": [44], "with": [45, 157], "some": [46, 75], "loss": [47], "specificity.": [49], "Within": [50], "abdomen": [52], "pelvis,": [54], "accuracy": [56], "examination": [59], "markedly": [60], "diminishes.": [61], "The": [62, 78], "size": [63], "threshold": [64], "for": [65, 144], "reliable": [66], "(90%)": [67], "lesion": [68], "detection": [69], "increases": [70], "several": [72], "centimeters": [73], "disease": [76], "states.": [77], "tumor": [79], "biology": [80], "dissemination": [83, 91, 134], "on": [84, 135], "abdominopelvic": [85], "surfaces": [86, 139], "differs": [87], "considerably": [88], "from": [89], "that": [92], "occurs": [93], "through": [94, 98], "lymphatic": [95], "channels": [96], "bloodstream.": [100], "In": [101], "this": [102], "chapter": [103], "we": [104], "attempt": [105], "use": [107], "natural": [109], "history": [110], "peritoneal": [112, 158], "carcinomatosis": [113, 159], "Sarcomatosis": [115, 161], "assist": [117], "interpretation": [120], "radiologic": [122, 126], "findings.": [123], "Also,": [124], "unique": [125], "features": [127], "mucinous": [129], "adenocarcinoma,": [130, 131], "sarcoma": [133], "abdominal": [136, 151], "pelvic": [138, 153], "are": [140], "illustrated.": [141], "A": [142], "search": [143], "a": [145], "new": [146], "level": [147], "understanding": [149], "patients": [156], "is": [162], "sought.": [163]}, "authors": ["Ann G.

Computed tomography (CT) will reliably detect lesions of 1 cm diameter in all these locations. Special studies can make the CT even more sensitive with some loss of specificity. Within the abdomen and pelvis, the accuracy of CT examination markedly diminishes. The size threshold for reliable (90%) lesion detection increases to several centimeters in some disease states. The tumor biology of cancer dissemination on abdominopelvic surfaces differs considerably from the dissemination that occurs through lymphatic channels or through the bloodstream. In this chapter we attempt to use the natural history of peritoneal carcinomatosis and Sarcomatosis to assist in the interpretation of radiologic findings. Also, unique radiologic features of mucinous adenocarcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and sarcoma dissemination on abdominal and pelvic surfaces are illustrated.

Essentially, cerebral cystic lesions may be classified into the following categories: Cysts containing CSF-like fluid, which include ex vacuo type cysts, such as leptomeningeal cysts, and cysts following surgical resection; cysts with fluid secreting walls and CSF-like content, such as arachnoid cysts; cysts associated with dysgenesis, for example Dandy-Walker cysts. The ex vacuo cysts increase craniospinal compliance, whereas the other cysts with CSF-like content do not; they are not per se expansive, however, although their occasional location along CSF pathways may cause obstruction and hydrocephalus. Another category includes cysts with a lining of non-neural epithelium like colloid cysts, epidermoid cysts, or craniopharyngiomas. They may increase in size and cause symptoms by compression, although not at the rate of tumour-associated cysts. The cysts associated with gliomas and other tumours have a pathogenesis bearing upon blood-brain barrier impairment and formation of vasogenic oedema. Finally, one may distinguish a category of cysts with infectious origin, such as brain abscesses and hydatid cysts. The cysts with CSF-like contents may be recognised by their magnetic resonance characteristics resembling those of CSF, whereas cysts containing proteinaceous fluid are associated with blood-brain barrier impairment and consequent contrast enhancement. The cysts with a lining of non-neural epithelium exhibit diverse properties of attenuation on comput tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), depending on the nature of their cyst contents."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2036707805", "relevance_score": 301.42444, "publication_year": 2010, "title": "Reliability of the ECASS Radiological Classification of Postthrombolysis Brain Haemorrhage: A Comparison of CT and Three MRI Sequences", "cited_by_count": 49, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery", "level": 3, "score": 0.75322795}, {"display_name": "Concordance", "level": 2, "score": 0.7358341}, {"display_name": "Nuclear medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.5414368}, {"display_name": "Kappa", "level": 2, "score": 0.5172377}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.5116523}, {"display_name": "Reproducibility", "level": 2, "score": 0.4771309}, {"display_name": "Acute stroke", "level": 3, "score": 0.44603047}, {"display_name": "Stroke (engine)", "level": 2, "score": 0.41187853}, {"display_name": "Magnetic resonance imaging", "level": 2, "score": 0.41111666}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"&lt;i&gt;Background:&lt;/i&gt;": [0], "Postthrombolysis": [1], "brain": [2], "haemorrhagic": [3], "transformations": [4], "(HT)": [5], "are": [6], "often": [7], "categorized": [8, 125], "with": [9, 58, 112], "the": [10, 14, 26, 41, 68, 113, 142, 186, 200], "CT-based": [11], "classification": [12, 30, 48, 143], "of": [13, 28, 46, 67, 107, 141], "European": [15], "Cooperative": [16], "Acute": [17], "Stroke": [18], "Study": [19], "(ECASS).": [20], "However,": [21], "little": [22], "is": [23, 185], "known": [24], "about": [25], "reliability": [27, 45, 198], "this": [29, 47, 207], "and": [31, 43, 51, 79, 121, 137, 149, 154, 174, 179, 194], "its": [32], "extension": [33], "to": [34, 39, 95, 128, 190, 212], "MRI.": [35], "Our": [36], "objective": [37], "was": [38, 124, 144, 167], "compare": [40], "inter-": [42, 136], "intraobserver": [44, 122, 138], "on": [49, 61, 100, 131], "CT": [50, 62, 150], "3": [52, 69], "MRI": [53, 70], "sequences.": [54], "&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;": [55], "Forty-three": [56], "patients": [57, 89], "postthrombolysis": [59, 192], "HT": [60, 193, 214], "or": [63], "at": [64], "least": [65], "1": [66], "sequences:": [71], "fluid-attenuation": [72], "inversion": [73], "recovery": [74], "(FLAIR),": [75], "diffusion-weighted": [76], "imaging": [77], "(DWI),": [78], "T2*": [80], "gradient": [81], "recalled": [82], "echo": [83], "(T2*GRE)": [84], "were": [85, 93, 109], "selected.": [86], "Twelve": [87], "control": [88], "without": [90], "any": [91], "bleeding": [92], "added": [94], "avoid": [96], "a": [97, 101], "bias": [98], "based": [99], "pure": [102], "HT-positive": [103], "cohort.": [104], "Each": [105], "series": [106], "images": [108], "independently": [110], "classified": [111], "ECASS": [114], "method": [115, 189], "by": [116], "6": [117], "blinded": [118], "observers.": [119], "Inter-": [120], "reproducibility": [123], "from": [126], "poor": [127], "excellent": [129, 168, 197], "depending": [130], "\u0138": [132], "values.": [133], "&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;": [134], "The": [135, 161, 182], "overall": [139], "concordance": [140, 163], "good": [145], "for": [146, 156, 164, 169, 176, 199], "T2*GRE,": [147], "DWI": [148], "(\u0138": [151, 158, 171], "&gt;": [152, 172], "0.6)": [153], "moderate": [155, 175], "FLAIR": [157, 178], "&lt;": [159], "0.6).": [160], "interobserver": [162], "parenchymal": [165, 202], "haematomas": [166], "T2*GRE": [170, 183], "0.8)": [173], "CT,": [177], "DWI.": [180], "&lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;": [181], "sequence": [184, 208], "most": [187], "reproducible": [188], "categorize": [191], "has": [195], "an": [196], "severe": [201], "haematoma": [203], "category,": [204], "suggesting": [205], "that": [206], "should": [209], "be": [210], "used": [211], "assess": [213], "in": [215], "thrombolytic": [216], "therapy": [217], "trials.": [218]}, "authors": ["Pauline Renou", "Igor Sibon", "Thomas Tourdias", "Fran\u00e7ois Rouanet", "Charlotte Rosso", "Damien Galanaud", "Aur\u00e9lie Drier", "M.

However, little is known about the reliability of this classification and its extension to MRI. Our objective was to compare the inter- and intraobserver reliability of this classification on CT and 3 MRI sequences. &lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt; Forty-three patients with postthrombolysis HT on CT or at least 1 of the 3 MRI sequences: fluid-attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and T2* gradient recalled echo (T2*GRE) were selected. Twelve control patients without any bleeding were added to avoid a bias based on a pure HT-positive cohort. Each series of images were independently classified with the ECASS method by 6 blinded observers. Inter- and intraobserver reproducibility was categorized from poor to excellent depending on \u0138 values. &lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt; The inter- and intraobserver overall concordance of the classification was good for T2*GRE, DWI and CT (\u0138 &gt; 0.6) and moderate for FLAIR (\u0138 &lt; 0.6). The interobserver concordance for parenchymal haematomas was excellent for T2*GRE (\u0138 &gt; 0.8) and moderate for CT, FLAIR and DWI. &lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt; The T2*GRE sequence is the most reproducible method to categorize postthrombolysis HT and has an excellent reliability for the severe parenchymal haematoma category, suggesting that this sequence should be used to assess HT in thrombolytic therapy trials."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2362251916", "relevance_score": 279.94077, "publication_year": 2012, "title": "The Value of Radiologic Interventions and 18F-DOPA PET in Diagnosing and Localizing Focal Congenital Hyperinsulinism: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis", "cited_by_count": 49, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Meta-analysis", "level": 2, "score": 0.7416362}, {"display_name": "Diagnostic odds ratio", "level": 3, "score": 0.7342563}, {"display_name": "Study heterogeneity", "level": 3, "score": 0.49683765}, {"display_name": "Positron emission tomography", "level": 2, "score": 0.48855194}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.47355214}, {"display_name": "Odds ratio", "level": 2, "score": 0.44692254}, {"display_name": "Critical appraisal", "level": 3, "score": 0.4360875}, {"display_name": "Systematic review", "level": 3, "score": 0.4348899}, {"display_name": "MEDLINE", "level": 2, "score": 0.38652894}, {"display_name": "Nuclear medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.36085233}, {"display_name": "Internal medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.2646357}, {"display_name": "Pathology", "level": 1, "score": 0.22727835}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"This": [0, 40, 198], "systematic": [1, 41, 199], "review": [2, 42, 200], "and": [3, 26, 34, 43, 55, 74, 91, 111, 135, 152, 159, 177, 187, 201, 213], "meta-analysis": [4, 44, 202], "aimed": [5], "to": [6, 48, 67, 89, 130, 193], "quantify": [7], "the": [8, 49, 85, 96, 106, 146, 165, 195, 206], "diagnostic": [9, 112, 196], "performance": [10], "of": [11, 57, 95, 101, 167, 175, 190, 208], "pancreatic": [12, 17], "venous": [13, 23], "sampling": [14, 24], "(PVS),": [15], "selective": [16], "arterial": [18], "calcium": [19], "stimulation": [20], "with": [21, 169, 183], "hepatic": [22], "(ASVS),": [25], "18F-DOPA": [27, 116, 209], "positron": [28], "emission": [29], "tomography": [30], "(PET)": [31], "in": [32, 120, 145, 211, 217], "diagnosing": [33, 212], "localizing": [35, 214], "focal": [36, 122, 143, 215], "congenital": [37], "hyperinsulinism": [38], "(CHI).": [39], "was": [45, 118], "conducted": [46], "according": [47, 88], "PRISMA": [50], "statement.": [51], "PubMed,": [52], "EMBASE,": [53], "SCOPUS": [54], "Web": [56], "Science": [58], "electronic": [59], "databases": [60], "were": [61], "systematically": [62], "searched": [63], "from": [64, 123], "their": [65, 180], "inception": [66], "November": [68], "1,": [69], "2011.": [70], "Using": [71], "predefined": [72], "inclusion": [73, 166], "exclusion": [75], "criteria,": [76], "two": [77], "blinded": [78], "reviewers": [79], "selected": [80], "articles.": [81], "Critical": [82], "appraisal": [83], "ranked": [84], "retrieved": [86], "articles": [87], "relevance": [90], "validity": [92], "by": [93], "means": [94], "QUADAS-2": [97], "criteria.": [98], "Pooled": [99], "data": [100], "homogeneous": [102], "study": [103], "results": [104], "estimated": [105], "sensitivity,": [107], "specificity,": [108], "likelihood": [109], "ratios": [110], "odds": [113], "ratio": [114], "(DOR).": [115], "PET": [117, 210], "superior": [119], "distinguishing": [121], "diffuse": [124], "CHI": [125, 144, 216], "(summary": [126, 132, 137], "DOR,": [127, 133, 138], "73.2)": [128], "compared": [129], "PVS": [131, 151], "23.5)": [134], "ASVS": [136, 153], "4.3).": [139], "Furthermore,": [140], "it": [141], "localized": [142], "pancreas": [147], "more": [148], "accurately": [149], "than": [150], "(pooled": [154], "accuracy,": [155], "0.82": [156], "vs.": [157], "0.76,": [158], "0.64,": [160], "respectively).": [161], "Important": [162], "limitations": [163], "comprised": [164], "studies": [168], "small": [170, 184], "sample": [171, 185], "sizes,": [172], "high": [173, 188], "probability": [174, 189], "bias": [176, 191], "heterogeneity": [178], "among": [179], "results.": [181], "Studies": [182], "sizes": [186], "tended": [192], "overestimate": [194], "accuracy.": [197], "found": [203], "evidence": [204], "for": [205, 221], "superiority": [207], "patients": [218], "requiring": [219], "surgery": [220], "this": [222], "disease.": [223]}, "authors": ["Bj\u00f6rn Alexander Blomberg", "Mateen Moghbel", "Babak Saboury", "Charles A.

This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted according to the PRISMA statement. PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS and Web of Science electronic databases were systematically searched from their inception to November 1, 2011. Using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, two blinded reviewers selected articles. Critical appraisal ranked the retrieved articles according to relevance and validity by means of the QUADAS-2 criteria. Pooled data of homogeneous study results estimated the sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR). 18F-DOPA PET was superior in distinguishing focal from diffuse CHI (summary DOR, 73.2) compared to PVS (summary DOR, 23.5) and ASVS (summary DOR, 4.3). Furthermore, it localized focal CHI in the pancreas more accurately than PVS and ASVS (pooled accuracy, 0.82 vs. 0.76, and 0.64, respectively). Important limitations comprised the inclusion of studies with small sample sizes, high probability of bias and heterogeneity among their results. Studies with small sample sizes and high probability of bias tended to overestimate the diagnostic accuracy.

A retrospective, radiographical study. Objective. To evaluate short-term radiological changes in sagittal alignment after lumbar decompression without fusion for lumbar canal stenosis. Summary of Background Data. Although the importance of global sagittal balance is underscored recently, little is known about the changes in sagittal alignment after lumbar canal decompression. Methods. We retrospectively reviewed 88 patients who underwent lumbar decompression without fusion at a single institution between November 2008 and May 2013, with a minimum follow-up of 5 months. Standing radiographs at the preoperative period and the final follow-up were assessed. Radiological parameters included the sagittal vertical axis (SVA), lumbar lordosis (LL), pelvic tilt, pelvic incidence (PI), occipital 7th cervical angle, and thoracic kyphosis, which were measured by 2 spine surgeons. The Zurich Claudication Questionnaire and visual analogue scale scores were obtained to assess the patient-based clinical outcomes. Results. Both LL and thoracic kyphosis significantly increased postoperatively, whereas SVA, PI-LL (PI minus LL), and pelvic tilt significantly decreased (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences between the preoperative and postoperative occipital 7th cervical angle and PI. The amount of increment in LL was greater in patients with small preoperative LL. The improvement in SVA was greater in those with a large preoperative SVA. The Zurich Claudication Questionnaire and visual analogue scale scores showed no significant correlation with the radiological parameters. Conclusion. Lumbar decompression without fusion can induce a reactive improvement in the lumbar and global sagittal alignment even if a sagittal imbalance exists preoperatively. Level of Evidence: 4 Short-term radiological changes in sagittal alignment after lumbar decompression without fusion for lumbar canal stenosis were investigated. Reactive improvement in lumbar and global sagittal alignment was observed even with the existence of preoperative malalignment."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2115383897", "relevance_score": 242.88187, "publication_year": 1962, "title": "Radiological appearances in pulmonary aspergillosis", "cited_by_count": 49, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Radiological weapon", "level": 2, "score": 0.68300647}, {"display_name": "Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis", "level": 4, "score": 0.6349298}, {"display_name": "Mycetoma", "level": 2, "score": 0.6286973}, {"display_name": "Aspergillosis", "level": 2, "score": 0.5917601}, {"display_name": "Asthma", "level": 2, "score": 0.55145836}, {"display_name": "Dermatology", "level": 1, "score": 0.40386808}, {"display_name": "Surgery", "level": 1, "score": 0.31983837}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Summary": [0], "The": [3, 44, 56, 139, 183], "radiological": [4], "appearances": [5], "of": [6, 12, 18, 34, 77, 95, 99, 113, 128, 150, 170, 177], "the": [7, 19, 50, 93, 96, 114, 159, 180], "saprophytic": [8, 20], "and": [9, 36, 65, 91, 126, 132, 148, 166], "allergic": [10, 115, 181], "types": [11, 136], "aspergillosis": [13], "are": [14, 22, 109, 117, 137, 185], "described.": [15, 138], "Twenty-five": [16], "cases": [17, 86, 141], "type": [21, 116], "analysed.": [23], "Their": [24], "ages": [25], "ranged": [26], "from": [27, 155, 189], "fifteen": [28], "to": [29, 41, 157], "seventy,": [30], "with": [31, 103, 123, 145], "an": [32], "average": [33, 160], "forty-seven,": [35], "there": [37], "were": [38, 49, 66, 88], "nineteen": [39], "men": [40], "six": [42], "women.": [43], "sites": [45], "most": [46, 67], "commonly": [47], "affected": [48], "upper": [51], "lobes,": [52], "in": [53, 63, 70, 81, 179], "twenty-one": [54], "cases.": [55, 83, 191], "cavities": [57], "averaged": [58], "55": [59], "\u00d7": [60], "35": [61], "mm.": [62], "size,": [64], "frequently": [68], "oval": [69], "shape": [71], "(twelve": [72], "cases).": [73], "There": [74, 173], "was": [75, 174], "evidence": [76], "other": [78], "lung": [79], "disease": [80], "twenty": [82], "In": [84], "eight": [85], "films": [87], "available": [89], "before": [90], "after": [92], "appearance": [94], "mycetoma.": [97], "Five": [98], "these": [100, 135], "cases,": [101], "together": [102], "five": [104, 149, 190], "others": [105], "showing": [106], "unusual": [107], "features,": [108], "illustrated.": [110], "Cases": [112], "divided": [118], "into": [119], "two": [120], "categories,": [121], "those": [122, 127, 169], "long-standing": [124, 164], "asthma,": [125], "recent": [129, 151, 171], "onset.": [130, 152, 172], "Similarities": [131], "differences": [133], "between": [134], "twelve": [140], "analysed": [142], "include": [143], "seven": [144], "previous": [146], "asthma": [147], "Ages": [153], "varied": [154], "ten": [156], "fifty-eight,": [158], "being": [161], "twenty-nine": [162], "for": [163, 168], "asthmatics": [165], "forty-four": [167], "a": [175], "predominance": [176], "women": [178], "type.": [182], "findings": [184], "amplified": [186], "by": [187], "illustrations": [188]}, "authors": ["B.

Their ages ranged from fifteen to seventy, with an average of forty-seven, and there were nineteen men to six women. The sites most commonly affected were the upper lobes, in twenty-one cases. The cavities averaged 55 \u00d7 35 mm. in size, and were most frequently oval in shape (twelve cases). There was evidence of other lung disease in twenty cases. In eight cases films were available before and after the appearance of the mycetoma. Five of these cases, together with five others showing unusual features, are illustrated. Cases of the allergic type are divided into two categories, those with long-standing asthma, and those of recent onset. Similarities and differences between these types are described.

Currently, retrospective studies on IPAF patients have proven to be heterogeneous in general characteristics, outcomes and High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) pattern. This study aims to describe for the first time the clinical, serological and radiological features of a prospective cohort of IPAF patients. This cohort is then compared to a group of patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF).Material and methodsFrom 626 consecutive ILD patients evaluated, 45 IPAF and a comparison cohort of 143 IPF patients were enrolled. All patients underwent clinical assessment with rheumatologic and respiratory evaluation, HRCT, Pulmonary Function Tests and Nailfold Videocapillaroscopy.ResultsThe IPAF patients had a predominance of female gender (62.12%) with a median age of 66 years. The most common findings were: Nonspecific Interstitial Pneumonia (NSIP, 68.89%), Antinuclear Antibody positivity (17.77%) and Raynaud Phenomenon (31.11%). In comparison with IPF, IPAF patients showed younger age, better performances in Pulmonary Function Tests, less necessity of O2 support and predominance of female sex and NSIP pattern.DiscussionThis is the first report of a prospective cohort of IPAF patients. IPAF patients seem to have a less severe lung disease than IPF. IPAF criteria probably need to be revisited and validated, but their capacity to recruit patients with incomplete forms or early onset of CTD could be useful for further research."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2098278104", "relevance_score": 334.76294, "publication_year": 1973, "title": "Radiological Classification of Congenital Pseudarthrosis of the Tibia", "cited_by_count": 48, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Radiological weapon", "level": 2, "score": 0.79143846}, {"display_name": "Pseudarthrosis", "level": 2, "score": 0.77677727}, {"display_name": "Tibia", "level": 2, "score": 0.70068604}, {"display_name": "Adamantinoma", "level": 4, "score": 0.42472583}, {"display_name": "Surgery", "level": 1, "score": 0.39635748}, {"display_name": "Anatomy", "level": 1, "score": 0.2533424}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"(1973).": [0], "Radiological": [1], "Classification": [2], "of": [3, 6], "Congenital": [4], "Pseudarthrosis": [5], "the": [7], "Tibia.": [8], "Acta": [9], "Orthopaedica": [10], "Scandinavica:": [11], "Vol.": [12], "44,": [13], "No.": [14], "6,": [15], "pp.": [16], "719-727.": [17]}, "authors": ["Kim Francis Andersen"], "abstract": "(1973).

It is vital that these reports be crafted so as to both reflect the radiologist\u2019s expertise and capability and eliminate any factors that might result in unintended harm to the patient. Unfortunately, a deficient report may result in legal action against the radiologist; thus, a thorough understanding of the litigious potential of the language used in radiology reports is crucial. It is important that ambiguous vocabulary, undefined modifiers, double negatives, and generalizations be avoided. Errors in radiology reports may result from inappropriate terminology, transcription mistakes, or deficient or inadequately documented communication. Critical findings that may have an immediate impact on patient management must be promptly communicated to the referring physician and such communication fully documented. A meticulous and well-written report is the best way for radiologists to care for their patients. In addition, a well-worded report can be the deciding factor in a successful defense against a malpractice claim.

Modern approaches to patient safety have shifted from a focus on individual performance and reaction to errors to development of robust systems and processes that create safety in organizations. Organizations that operate safely in high-risk environments have been termed high-reliability organizations. Such organizations tend to see themselves as being constantly bombarded by errors. Thus, the goal is not to eliminate human error but to develop strategies to prevent, identify, and mitigate errors and their effects before they result in harm. High-level reliability strategies focus on systems and organizational culture; intermediate-level reliability strategies focus on establishment of effective processes; low-level reliability strategies focus on individual performance. Although several classification schemes for human error exist, modern safety researchers caution against overreliance on error investigations to improve safety. Blaming individuals involved in adverse events when they had no intent to cause harm has been shown to undermine organizational safety. Safety researchers have coined the term just culture for the successful balance of individual accountability with accommodation for human fallibility and system deficiencies. Safety is inextricably intertwined with an organization's quality efforts. A quality management system that focuses on standardization, making errors visible, building in quality, and constantly stopping to fix problems results in a safer environment and engages personnel in a way that contributes to a culture of safety."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2315005380", "relevance_score": 273.4603, "publication_year": 2015, "title": "Radiological Determination of

To determine best criteria for radiological determination of postoperative subaxial cervical fusion to be applied to current clinical practice and ongoing future research assessing fusion to standardize assessment and improve comparability. Summary of Background Data. Despite availability of multiple imaging modalities and criteria, there remains no method of determining cervical fusion with absolute certainty, nor clear consensus on specific criteria to be applied. Methods. A systematic search in MEDLINE/Cochrane Collaboration Library (through March 2014). Included studies assessed C2 to C7 via anterior or posterior approach, at 12 weeks or more postoperative, with any graft or implant. Overall body of evidence with respect to 6 posited key questions was determined using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality precepts. Results. Of plain radiographical modalities, there is moderate evidence that the interspinous process motion method (<1 mm) is more accurate than the Cobb angle method for assessing anterior cervical fusion. Of the advanced imaging modalities, there is moderate evidence that computed tomography (CT) is more accurate and reliable than magnetic resonance imaging in assessing anterior cervical fusion. There is insufficient evidence regarding the optimal modality and criteria for assessing posterior cervical fusions and insufficient evidence to support a single time point after surgery as being optimal for determining fusion, although some evidence suggest that reliability of radiography and CT improves with increasing time postoperatively. Conclusion. We recommend using less than 1-mm motion as the initial modality for determining anterior cervical arthrodesis for both clinical and research applications. If further imaging is needed because of indeterminate radiographical evaluation, we recommend CT, which has relatively high accuracy and reliability, but due to greater radiation exposure and cost, it is not routinely suggested. We recommend that plain radiographs also be the initial method of determining posterior cervical fusion but suggest a lower threshold for obtaining CT scans because dynamic radiographs may not be as useful if spinous processes have been removed by laminectomy. Level of Evidence: 1 A systematic review determined the most accurate and reliable methods of assessing postoperative subaxial cervical fusion for clinical and research applications. Less than 1-mm motion criteria are recommended for initially assessing anterior fusion. Plain radiographs are also initially recommended when evaluating posterior fusion. Computed tomography should be reserved when initial evaluation is indeterminate."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2326138347", "relevance_score": 268.84326, "publication_year": 1997, "title": "Radiologic Prevalence of Advanced Lateral C1-C2 Osteoarthritis", "cited_by_count": 48, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Osteoarthritis", "level": 3, "score": 0.73540235}, {"display_name": "Radiography", "level": 2, "score": 0.67289764}, {"display_name": "Neck pain", "level": 3, "score": 0.5475739}, {"display_name": "Atlantoaxial instability", "level": 3, "score": 0.5119165}, {"display_name": "Atlanto-axial joint", "level": 3, "score": 0.44400862}, {"display_name": "Paranasal sinuses", "level": 2, "score": 0.43469542}, {"display_name": "Degenerative disease", "level": 3, "score": 0.43377838}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.41879046}, {"display_name": "Surgery", "level": 1, "score": 0.3723949}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Study": [0], "Design.": [1], "The": [2, 118], "lateral": [3, 28, 73, 86, 127, 158], "C1-C2": [4], "(atlantoaxial)": [5], "joints": [6, 75, 160], "were": [7, 69, 76, 106], "evaluated": [8, 70], "retrospectively": [9], "in": [10, 47, 82, 113, 139, 145, 171, 175], "355": [11, 83], "patients": [12, 177], "referred": [13, 45], "for": [14], "radiographs": [15, 64], "of": [16, 26, 32, 55, 65, 98, 115, 121, 149], "the": [17, 23, 48, 52, 66, 99, 116, 126, 140, 146, 157, 172], "paranasal": [18, 67], "sinuses.": [19], "Objectives.": [20], "To": [21], "determine": [22], "radiologic": [24, 53, 119], "prevalence": [25, 54, 120], "advanced": [27, 94, 122, 153], "atlantoaxial": [29, 42, 74, 87, 128, 159], "osteoarthritis.": [30], "Summary": [31], "Background": [33], "Data.": [34], "Previous": [35], "studies": [36], "have": [37], "shown": [38], "a": [39], "relation": [40], "between": [41], "osteoarthritis": [43, 110], "and": [44], "pain": [46], "suboccipital": [49, 163], "region.": [50], "However,": [51], "this": [56, 179], "degenerative": [57, 123, 154], "disorder": [58], "is": [59], "unknown.": [60], "Methods.": [61], "Five": [62], "hundred": [63], "sinuses": [68], "retrospectively.": [71], "Both": [72], "clearly": [77], "visible": [78], "on": [79], "occipitofrontal": [80], "projections": [81], "examinations.": [84], "Each": [85], "joint": [88, 100], "was": [89, 111, 130], "considered": [90], "severely": [91], "degenerated": [92], "when": [93], "narrowing": [95], "or": [96], "obliteration": [97], "space,": [101], "subchondral": [102], "sclerosis,": [103], "and/or": [104], "osteophytosis": [105], "present.": [107], "Results.": [108], "Atlantoaxial": [109], "found": [112, 131], "4.8%": [114], "patients.": [117], "changes": [124, 155], "at": [125, 156], "joint(s)": [129], "to": [132, 143], "increase": [133], "with": [134, 178], "age,": [135], "ranging": [136], "from": [137], "5.4%": [138], "sixth": [141], "decade": [142, 148], "18.2%": [144], "ninth": [147], "life.": [150], "Conclusion.": [151], "Because": [152], "can": [161], "cause": [162], "neck": [164], "pain,": [165], "these": [166], "findings": [167], "should": [168], "be": [169], "included": [170], "differential": [173], "diagnosis": [174], "older": [176], "symptom.": [180]}, "authors": ["J.

Objectives. To determine the radiologic prevalence of advanced lateral atlantoaxial osteoarthritis. Summary of Background Data. Previous studies have shown a relation between atlantoaxial osteoarthritis and referred pain in the suboccipital region. However, the radiologic prevalence of this degenerative disorder is unknown. Methods. Five hundred radiographs of the paranasal sinuses were evaluated retrospectively. Both lateral atlantoaxial joints were clearly visible on occipitofrontal projections in 355 examinations. Each lateral atlantoaxial joint was considered severely degenerated when advanced narrowing or obliteration of the joint space, subchondral sclerosis, and/or osteophytosis were present. Results. Atlantoaxial osteoarthritis was found in 4.8% of the patients. The radiologic prevalence of advanced degenerative changes at the lateral atlantoaxial joint(s) was found to increase with age, ranging from 5.4% in the sixth decade to 18.2% in the ninth decade of life. Conclusion. Because advanced degenerative changes at the lateral atlantoaxial joints can cause suboccipital neck pain, these findings should be included in the differential diagnosis in older patients with this symptom."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W3018336394", "relevance_score": 267.15082, "publication_year": 2020, "title": "Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Radiology Education\u2014Strategies for Survival", "cited_by_count": 48, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)", "level": 4, "score": 0.7604419}, {"display_name": "Pandemic", "level": 5, "score": 0.6736313}, {"display_name": "Status quo", "level": 2, "score": 0.5827037}, {"display_name": "Social distance", "level": 5, "score": 0.5643278}, {"display_name": "Medical education", "level": 1, "score": 0.5397329}, {"display_name": "Distance education", "level": 2, "score": 0.53770167}, {"display_name": "Globe", "level": 2, "score": 0.5029318}, {"display_name": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)", "level": 5, "score": 0.49584374}, {"display_name": "Experiential learning", "level": 2, "score": 0.46834537}, {"display_name": "2019-20 coronavirus outbreak", "level": 3, "score": 0.46102864}, {"display_name": "Field (mathematics)", "level": 2, "score": 0.42490852}, {"display_name": "Public relations", "level": 1, "score": 0.39798254}, {"display_name": "Disease", "level": 2, "score": 0.2565474}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"In": [0, 138], "summary,": [1], "the": [2, 7, 65, 89, 94, 100, 149], "COVID-19": [3, 140], "pandemic": [4], "has": [5, 11, 82], "challenged": [6], "status": [8], "quo": [9], "but": [10], "led": [12], "to": [13, 42, 61, 85, 114, 132, 135], "rapid": [14, 75], "adoption": [15], "of": [16, 24, 71, 79], "virtual": [17], "and": [18, 54, 63, 76, 91, 96, 105, 120, 130], "experiential": [19], "learning": [20, 81], "opportunities": [21], "that": [22], "none": [23], "us": [25], "could": [26], "have": [27, 36], "imagined": [28], "just": [29, 142], "a": [30, 40], "few": [31], "months": [32], "ago.": [33], "Most": [34], "institutions": [35], "embraced": [37], "technology": [38], "as": [39], "means": [41], "maintain": [43], "normalcy.": [44], "Virtual": [45], "meetings": [46], "preserve": [47], "dedicated": [48], "teaching": [49], "conferences": [50], "for": [51], "both": [52], "trainees": [53], "medical": [55], "students,": [56], "facilitate": [57], "ongoing": [58], "workstation": [59], "feedback": [60], "residents,": [62], "bring": [64], "community": [66], "together": [67], "in": [68, 148], "this": [69], "era": [70], "social": [72], "distancing.": [73], "This": [74], "exponential": [77], "integration": [78], "distance": [80], "great": [83], "promise": [84], "reach": [86], "learners": [87], "across": [88], "globe": [90], "potentially": [92], "attract": [93], "best": [95, 115], "brightest": [97], "students": [98], "into": [99], "field.": [101], "For": [102], "residency": [103], "programs": [104], "trainees,": [106], "although": [107], "there": [108], "remains": [109], "some": [110], "uncertainty": [111], "around": [112], "how": [113, 145], "meet": [116], "expected": [117], "case": [118], "logs": [119], "rotation": [121], "requirements,": [122], "we": [123, 146], "must": [124], "all": [125], "remain": [126], "adaptable,": [127], "embrace": [128], "innovation,": [129], "continue": [131], "add": [133], "value": [134], "patient": [136], "care.": [137], "fact,": [139], "may": [141], "be": [143], "revolutionizing": [144], "teach": [147], "future.": [150]}, "authors": ["Priscilla J.

Frequently, the diagnosis and follow up of EBTB lesion during treatment mainly depend on bronchoscopy. Chest computed tomography (CT) and pulmonary function test (PFT) have also been used in evaluating EBTB and differentiating it from the other diseases. Primary purpose of the present study was to observe the change of EBTB lesion during treatment and determine the optimal time and the indication of follow-up bronchoscopy. We also evaluate the usefulness of chest CT and PFT in EBTB.Eighty-one biopsy-proven EBTB patients were enrolled from 1992 to 1997. Endobronchial tuberculosis was classified into seven subtypes: actively caseating, fibrostenotic, oedematous-hyperaemic, tumorous, ulcerative, granular, and non-specific bronchitic type according to bronchoscopic features by Chung's Classification. The change of bronchoscopic findings during treatment in each subtype of EBTB was evaluated prospectively. Follow-up bronchoscopy was done each month until there was no subsequent change in endobronchiat lesion, and every 3 months thereafter, and at the end of treatment. Chest CT and PFT were performed in 26 and 68 patients respectively, at initial bronchoscopy.Twenty-two of the 34 cases of actively caseating EBTB changed into the fibrostenotic type, and the other 12 healed without sequelae. Seven of the 11 cases of oedematous-hyperaemic EBTB changed into the fibrostenotic type, and the other four healed. Nine of the 11 cases of granular EBTB, six cases of non-specific bronchitic EBTB, and two cases of ulcerative EBTB resolved completely. However, the other two cases of granular EBTB changed into the fibrostenotic type. Seven cases of fibrostenotic EBTB did not improve despite antituberculosis chemotherapy. These various changes in bronchoscopic findings occurred within 3 months of treatment. In 10 cases of tumorous EBTB, seven progressed to the fibrostenotic type. In addition, new lesions appeared in two cases, and the size of the initial lesions increased in another two cases, even at 6 months after treatment. On chest CT findings of 26 EBTB patients, the length of bronchial involvement was measured from 10 to 55 mm. Bronchial stricture was noticed in 25 cases and the range of narrowing was from total occlusion to near normal, and there was wide variation in bronchial stricture even within same subtype of EBTB. The dominant feature of PFT in EBTB at the diagnosis was restrictive pattern.The therapeutic outcome of each subtype of EBTB can be predicted by follow-up bronchoscopy during the initial 3 months, with the exception of the tumorous type. In tumorous EBTB, the evolution of the lesions during treatment is very complicated, and bronchial stenosis may develop at a later time. Chest CT was useful in measuring the length of involved bronchus and degree of stricture in EBTB. PFT may be useful in differential diagnosis and follow up of EBTB."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2190521719", "relevance_score": 239.95792, "publication_year": 2016, "title": "Wide-area

Potential targets require an immediate decontamination response, or mitigation plan to limit the social and economic impact. To date, experience with urban decontamination of building materials - specifically hard, porous, external surfaces - is limited to nuclear weapon fallout and nuclear reactor accidents. Methods are lacking for performing wide-area decontamination in an urban environment so that in all release scenarios the area may be re-occupied without evaluation and/or restriction. Also lacking is experience in developing mitigation strategies, that is, methods of mitigating contamination and its resultant radiation dose in key areas during the immediate aftermath of an event and after lifesaving operations. To date, the tremendous strategy development effort primarily by the European community has focused on the recovery phase, which extends years beyond the release event. In this review, we summarize the methods and data collected over the past 70 years in the field of hard, external surface decontamination of radionuclide contaminations, with emphasis on methods suitable for response to radiological dispersal devices and their potentially unique physico-chemical characteristics. This review concludes that although a tremendous amount of work has been completed primarily by the European Community (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK), the few studies existing on each technique permit only very preliminary estimates of decontamination factors for various building materials and methods and extrapolation of those values for use in environments outside the EU and UK. This data shortage prevents us from developing an effective and detailed mitigation response plan and remediation effort. Perhaps most importantly, while the data available does include valuable information on the practical aspects of performing the various remediation methods including costs, coverage rates, manpower, pitfalls, etc., it lacks the details on lessons learned, best practices, and standard procedures, for instance, that would be required to develop a mitigation strategy. While the urban decontamination problem is difficult and there is much more research to do, the existing literature provides a framework for a response plan. Using this framework, in conjunction with computer modeling and relevant data collection, can lead to development of appropriate plans and exercises that would permit development of a mitigation and remediation response."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W1987503089", "relevance_score": 233.8418, "publication_year": 1977, "title": "Radiologically occult in situ and incipient invasive epidermoid lung cancer", "cited_by_count": 48, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Carcinoma in situ", "level": 3, "score": 0.8044802}, {"display_name": "Squamous metaplasia", "level": 3, "score": 0.76827693}, {"display_name": "Pathology", "level": 1, "score": 0.699695}, {"display_name": "Lung cancer", "level": 2, "score": 0.6610396}, {"display_name": "Metaplasia", "level": 2, "score": 0.6582465}, {"display_name": "Epidermoid carcinoma", "level": 3, "score": 0.58319736}, {"display_name": "Bronchus", "level": 4, "score": 0.572576}, {"display_name": "Carcinoma", "level": 2, "score": 0.51498514}, {"display_name": "Squamous carcinoma", "level": 3, "score": 0.4868931}, {"display_name": "Lung", "level": 2, "score": 0.47526497}, {"display_name": "Cancer", "level": 2, "score": 0.47245505}, {"display_name": "Atypical hyperplasia", "level": 3, "score": 0.4528691}, {"display_name": "Basal (medicine)", "level": 3, "score": 0.416198}, {"display_name": "Epithelium", "level": 2, "score": 0.39856827}, {"display_name": "Respiratory disease", "level": 3, "score": 0.35017005}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Approximately": [0], "8000": [1], "cigarette-smoking": [2], "men": [3, 41], "over": [4], "the": [5, 57, 69, 73, 109, 171], "age": [6], "of": [7, 23, 68, 94, 101, 111, 138, 175], "45": [8], "have": [9], "entered": [10], "into": [11], "a": [12, 114, 135], "lung": [13, 32, 141], "cancer": [14, 33], "detection": [15], "program": [16], "in": [17, 39, 48, 72, 92, 105, 117, 129, 156, 165], "New": [18], "York": [19], "City.": [20], "Cytologic": [21], "examinations": [22, 67], "sputum": [24], "were": [25, 62], "carried": [26], "out": [27], "on": [28], "4000": [29], "subjects": [30], "and": [31, 120], "was": [34, 82], "found": [35], "by": [36, 64], "this": [37], "technique": [38], "nine": [40], "with": [42], "normal": [43], "chest": [44], "x-rays.": [45], "Seven": [46], "had": [47], "situ": [49, 93], "or": [50, 98, 149, 173, 178, 191], "incipient": [51], "invasive": [52, 86], "epidermoid": [53, 87], "carcinoma": [54, 88, 91, 123, 162], "confined": [55], "to": [56, 170, 187], "bronchus.": [58], "These": [59], "seven": [60], "cases": [61], "studied": [63], "detailed": [65], "histologic": [66], "bronchial": [70, 95, 106, 166], "tree": [71], "resected": [74], "specimens": [75], "through": [76], "sixth": [77], "generation": [78], "subscgmental": [79], "bronchi.": [80], "It": [81, 143], "concluded": [83], "that:": [84], "1)": [85], "arises": [89], "from": [90], "surface": [96], "epithelium": [97, 104, 167], "an": [99, 153], "extension": [100], "that": [102, 146, 161, 189], "neoplastic": [103], "glands;": [107], "2)": [108], "site": [110], "origin": [112, 130], "is": [113, 134, 152], "segmental": [115], "bronchus": [116], "most": [118], "instances;": [119], "3)": [121], "each": [122], "should": [124, 182], "be": [125, 183], "considered": [126, 184], "as": [127], "unifocal": [128], "even": [131], "though": [132], "there": [133], "continuing": [136], "risk": [137], "another": [139], "primary": [140], "cancer.": [142], "seems": [144], "unlikely": [145], "squamous": [147, 179], "metaplasia": [148], "basal": [150, 176], "hyperplasia": [151, 177], "essential": [154], "step": [155], "carcinogenesis;": [157], "rather,": [158], "we": [159], "believe": [160], "may": [163, 190, 192], "arise": [164], "without": [168], "regard": [169], "presence": [172], "absence": [174], "metaplasia,": [180], "which": [181], "nonspecific": [185], "reactions": [186], "injury": [188], "not": [193], "accompany": [194], "carcinogenesis.": [195]}, "authors": ["Myron R.

Seven had in situ or incipient invasive epidermoid carcinoma confined to the bronchus. These seven cases were studied by detailed histologic examinations of the bronchial tree in the resected specimens through sixth generation subscgmental bronchi. It was concluded that: 1) invasive epidermoid carcinoma arises from carcinoma in situ of bronchial surface epithelium or an extension of that neoplastic epithelium in bronchial glands; 2) the site of origin is a segmental bronchus in most instances; and 3) each carcinoma should be considered as unifocal in origin even though there is a continuing risk of another primary lung cancer. It seems unlikely that squamous metaplasia or basal hyperplasia is an essential step in carcinogenesis; rather, we believe that carcinoma may arise in bronchial epithelium without regard to the presence or absence of basal hyperplasia or squamous metaplasia, which should be considered nonspecific reactions to injury that may or may not accompany carcinogenesis."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W3035331470", "relevance_score": 225.152, "publication_year": 2020, "title": "Radiological Society of North America Chest CT Classification System for Reporting COVID-19 Pneumonia: Interobserver Variability and Correlation with Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction", "cited_by_count": 48, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)", "level": 4, "score": 0.72942114}, {"display_name": "Radiological weapon", "level": 2, "score": 0.68641335}, {"display_name": "Pneumonia", "level": 2, "score": 0.6765673}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.6009897}, {"display_name": "Confidence interval", "level": 2, "score": 0.5802048}, {"display_name": "Nuclear medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.36410052}, {"display_name": "Internal medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.25885934}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Purpose": [0], "To": [1], "evaluate": [2], "the": [3, 49, 83, 134, 157, 171, 175, 200, 210, 245, 252], "Radiological": [4], "Society": [5], "of": [6, 27, 31, 70, 82, 113, 121, 194, 247], "North": [7], "America": [8], "(RSNA)": [9], "chest": [10, 41, 51, 85, 125, 158, 172, 201, 232], "CT": [11, 25, 52, 86, 126, 202, 233], "classification": [12, 53, 234], "system": [13, 54, 235], "for": [14, 55, 94, 209, 236, 258, 266], "reporting": [15, 56, 237], "coronavirus": [16], "disease": [17], "2019": [18], "(COVID-19)": [19], "pneumonia.": [20, 58], "Materials": [21], "and": [22, 36, 43, 91, 131, 148, 174, 185, 207, 224, 256], "Methods": [23], "Chest": [24], "scans": [26], "consecutive": [28], "patients": [29, 71, 102, 122, 195], "suspected": [30], "having": [32], "COVID-19": [33, 57, 79, 198, 238, 249], "were": [34, 111, 179], "retrospectively": [35], "independently": [37], "evaluated": [38, 62], "by": [39, 63, 133], "two": [40], "radiologists": [42, 159, 173], "a": [44], "5th-year": [45, 176], "radiology": [46, 177], "resident": [47, 178], "using": [48], "RSNA": [50, 231], "Interobserver": [59], "agreement": [60], "was": [61, 96, 160], "calculating": [64], "weighted": [65], "\u03ba": [66, 154, 168], "coefficients.": [67], "The": [68, 119, 153, 192, 230], "proportion": [69, 193, 246], "with": [72, 196], "real-time": [73], "reverse-transcription": [74], "polymerase": [75], "chain": [76], "reaction": [77], "(RT-PCR)\u2013confirmed": [78], "in": [80, 199, 251], "each": [81], "four": [84], "categories": [87, 127, 203, 253], "(typical,": [88], "indeterminate,": [89, 129, 205], "atypical,": [90, 130, 206], "negative": [92, 132, 208, 257], "features": [93], "COVID-19)": [95], "calculated.": [97], "Results": [98], "In": [99], "total,": [100], "96": [101], "(61": [103], "men;": [104], "median": [105], "age,": [106], "70": [107], "years": [108], "[range,": [109], "29\u201394])": [110], "included,": [112], "whom": [114], "45": [115], "had": [116], "RT-PCR\u2013confirmed": [117, 197, 248], "COVID-19.": [118], "number": [120], "assigned": [123], "to": [124, 140, 143, 146, 150, 216, 219, 222, 226], "typical,": [128, 204], "three": [135, 211], "readers": [136, 212], "ranged": [137, 213], "from": [138, 214], "18": [139], "29,": [141], "26": [142], "43,": [144], "19": [145], "31,": [147], "5": [149], "8,": [151], "respectively.": [152, 191, 228], "coefficient": [155], "among": [156, 170], "0.663": [161], "(95%": [162, 181, 187], "confidence": [163], "interval": [164], "[CI]:": [165], "0.565,": [166], "0.761).": [167], "coefficients": [169], "0.570": [180], "CI:": [182, 188], "0.443,": [183], "0.696)": [184], "0.564": [186], "0.451,": [189], "0.678),": [190], "76.9%": [215], "96.6%,": [217], "51.2%": [218], "64.1%,": [220], "2.8%": [221], "5.3%,": [223], "20%": [225], "25%,": [227], "Conclusion": [229], "pneumonia": [239, 259], "has": [240], "moderate-to-substantial": [241], "interobserver": [242], "agreement.": [243], "However,": [244], "cases": [250], "atypical": [254], "appearance": [255], "is": [260, 264], "nonnegligible.": [261], "Supplemental": [262], "material": [263], "available": [265], "this": [267], "article.": [268], "Keywords:": [269], "Adults,": [270], "CT,": [271], "Infection,": [272], "Lung,": [273], "Thorax": [274], "\u00a9": [275], "RSNA,": [276], "2020": [277]}, "authors": ["Tom M.

Materials and Methods Chest CT scans of consecutive patients suspected of having COVID-19 were retrospectively and independently evaluated by two chest radiologists and a 5th-year radiology resident using the RSNA chest CT classification system for reporting COVID-19 pneumonia. Interobserver agreement was evaluated by calculating weighted \u03ba coefficients. The proportion of patients with real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)\u2013confirmed COVID-19 in each of the four chest CT categories (typical, indeterminate, atypical, and negative features for COVID-19) was calculated. Results In total, 96 patients (61 men; median age, 70 years [range, 29\u201394]) were included, of whom 45 had RT-PCR\u2013confirmed COVID-19. The number of patients assigned to chest CT categories typical, indeterminate, atypical, and negative by the three readers ranged from 18 to 29, 26 to 43, 19 to 31, and 5 to 8, respectively. The \u03ba coefficient among the chest radiologists was 0.663 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.565, 0.761). \u03ba coefficients among the chest radiologists and the 5th-year radiology resident were 0.570 (95% CI: 0.443, 0.696) and 0.564 (95% CI: 0.451, 0.678), respectively. The proportion of patients with RT-PCR\u2013confirmed COVID-19 in the chest CT categories typical, indeterminate, atypical, and negative for the three readers ranged from 76.9% to 96.6%, 51.2% to 64.1%, 2.8% to 5.3%, and 20% to 25%, respectively. Conclusion The RSNA chest CT classification system for reporting COVID-19 pneumonia has moderate-to-substantial interobserver agreement. However, the proportion of RT-PCR\u2013confirmed COVID-19 cases in the categories atypical appearance and negative for pneumonia is nonnegligible. Supplemental material is available for this article.

Boonn"], "abstract": "There is growing interest in the ability to monitor, track, and report exposure to radiation from medical imaging. Historically, however, dose information has been stored on an image-based dose sheet, an arrangement that precludes widespread indexing. Although scanner manufacturers are beginning to include dose-related parameters in the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) headers of imaging studies, there remains a vast repository of retrospective computed tomographic (CT) data with image-based dose sheets. Consequently, it is difficult for imaging centers to monitor their dose estimates or participate in the American College of Radiology (ACR) Dose Index Registry. An automated extraction software pipeline known as Radiation Dose Intelligent Analytics for CT Examinations (RADIANCE) has been designed that quickly and accurately parses CT dose sheets to extract and archive dose-related parameters. Optical character recognition of information in the dose sheet leads to creation of a text file, which along with the DICOM study header is parsed to extract dose-related data. The data are then stored in a relational database that can be queried for dose monitoring and report creation. RADIANCE allows efficient dose analysis of CT examinations and more effective education of technologists, radiologists, and referring physicians regarding patient exposure to radiation at CT. RADIANCE also allows compliance with the ACR's dose reporting guidelines and greater awareness of patient radiation dose, ultimately resulting in improved patient care and treatment. \u00a9 RSNA, 2011"}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2019154723", "relevance_score": 354.19806, "publication_year": 2001, "title": "RADIOLOGY OF PNEUMONIA", "cited_by_count": 47, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Pneumonia", "level": 2, "score": 0.7599572}, {"display_name": "Lobar pneumonia", "level": 3, "score": 0.7221271}, {"display_name": "Etiology", "level": 2, "score": 0.5965041}, {"display_name": "Lung", "level": 2, "score": 0.5546848}, {"display_name": "Parenchyma", "level": 2, "score": 0.54972607}, {"display_name": "Pathology", "level": 1, "score": 0.53622705}, {"display_name": "Radiography", "level": 2, "score": 0.48929283}, {"display_name": "Respiratory disease", "level": 3, "score": 0.46805948}, {"display_name": "Population", "level": 2, "score": 0.43388543}, {"display_name": "Respiratory tract", "level": 3, "score": 0.42492765}, {"display_name": "Presentation (obstetrics)", "level": 2, "score": 0.4195272}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.3687517}, {"display_name": "Respiratory system", "level": 2, "score": 0.2772272}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Infection": [0], "of": [1, 9, 25, 66, 77, 79, 95, 99, 107, 120, 125, 132], "the": [2, 10, 15, 54, 58, 64, 74, 105, 108, 115, 121, 129, 133], "lower": [3], "respiratory": [4], "tract,": [5], "acquired": [6], "by": [7, 83], "way": [8], "airways": [11], "and": [12, 18, 40, 87, 117], "confined": [13], "to": [14], "lung": [16], "parenchyma": [17], "airways,": [19], "typically": [20], "presents": [21], "radiologically": [22], "as": [23, 73], "one": [24], "three": [26], "patterns:": [27], "(1)": [28], "focal": [29, 42], "nonsegmental": [30], "or": [31, 37, 43], "lobar": [32], "pneumonia,": [33, 39, 126], "(2)": [34], "multifocal": [35], "bronchopneumonia": [36], "lobular": [38], "(3)": [41], "diffuse": [44], "\"interstitial\"": [45], "pneumonia.": [46], "These": [47], "patterns": [48, 70], "can": [49], "be": [50], "useful": [51], "in": [52, 57, 128], "identifying": [53], "etiological": [55], "organism": [56], "appropriate": [59], "clinical": [60, 116], "setting.": [61], "To": [62], "serve": [63], "purpose": [65], "this": [67], "article,": [68], "these": [69], "are": [71, 91], "used": [72], "primary": [75], "method": [76], "classification": [78], "pulmonary": [80, 89], "infections": [81, 90], "caused": [82], "different": [84], "organisms.": [85], "Mycobacterial": [86], "fungal": [88], "reviewed": [92], "separately": [93], "because": [94], "their": [96], "wide": [97], "range": [98], "radiographic": [100, 118], "appearance": [101], "that": [102], "depend": [103], "on": [104], "stage": [106], "disease": [109], "at": [110], "presentation.": [111], "This": [112], "article": [113], "discusses": [114], "features": [119], "most": [122], "common": [123], "causes": [124], "primarily": [127], "adult": [130], "population": [131], "United": [134], "States.": [135]}, "authors": ["Ahmed M.

These patterns can be useful in identifying the etiological organism in the appropriate clinical setting. To serve the purpose of this article, these patterns are used as the primary method of classification of pulmonary infections caused by different organisms.

Materials and Methods: We studied 210 patients with symptoms, signs and radiological findings suggestive of renal cell carcinoma. Results: Final diagnosis in 6 of 210 patients (3 percent) was primary renal lymphoma. Radiological features were similar to those of renal cell carcinoma. Five of the 6 patients had an International Prognostic Index score of greater than 1. Despite appropriate chemotherapy, only 2 patients remain with complete remission. Conclusions: Primary renal lymphoma is unusual but not rare. The relatively poor prognosis in our patients could be attributed to the adverse prognostic factors associated with aggressive nodal lymphomas. References 1 : Primary lymphoma of kidney. J.

Only the external form of the implants differs slightly. It was our aim to examine the differences in radiographic bone response between the Alloclassic (second generation) and the Endoplus (third generation) femoral stems. We compared 79 prostheses in 70 matched patients studied over a minimum of two years. Radiolucent lines, adaptive bone remodelling, subsidence, heterotopic bone formation and lysis were recorded in the Gruen zones. Radiolucencies were mainly found in zones 1 and 7 but to a greater extent in the Endoplus than in the Alloclassic group (p &lt; 0.001 in zone 1, p &lt; 0.05 in zone 7). We found lucent lines in three or more Gruen zones in seven patients all of whom were in the Endoplus group (p &lt; 0.05). Zones 2 and 6 had a significantly higher rate of lucencies in the Endoplus group (p &lt; 0.001). We encountered a combination of proximal lucent lines in zones 1 and 7 with distal hypertrophy of the cortical bone in zones 2, 3, 5 and 6 in eight patients, all from the Endoplus group (p &lt; 0.05). In other patients bone atrophy (stress shielding) in zones 2 and 6 was seen more frequently in the Endoplus than in the Alloclassic group (p &lt; 0.001). In neither group was there radiological evidence of osteolysis. Heterotopic bone formation and subsidence occurred with similar frequency in both groups.

The Main Commission of ICRP is now considering a revised, simpler approach that is based on an individual-oriented philosophy and represents a potential shift by the Commission from the past emphasis on societal-oriented criteria. The initial proposals were promulgated through IRPA and an open literature publication was published in the Journal of Radiological Protection in June 1999. On the basis of comments received and the observations presented at the IRPA-10 Congress in May 2000, the Commission is beginning to develop the next recommendations. This article describes the issues involved in the preparation of the next recommendations and indicates the process that the Commission proposes to follow.

The quick identification and isolation of the affected persons is the very first step to fight against this virus. In this regard, chest radiology images have been proven to be an effective screening approach of COVID-19 affected patients. A number of AI based solutions have been developed to make the screening of radiological images faster and more accurate in detecting COVID-19. In this study, we are proposing a deep learning based approach using Densenet-121 to effectively detect COVID-19 patients. We incorporated transfer learning technique to leverage the information regarding radiology image learned by another model (CheXNet) which was trained on a huge Radiology dataset of 112,120 images. We trained and tested our model on COVIDx dataset containing 13,800 chest radiography images across 13,725 patients. To check the robustness of our model, we performed both two-class and three-class classifications and achieved 96.49% and 93.71% accuracy respectively. To further validate the consistency of our performance, we performed patient-wise k-fold cross-validation and achieved an average accuracy of 92.91% for three class task. Moreover, we performed an interpretability analysis using Grad-CAM to highlight the most important image regions in making a prediction. Besides ensuring trustworthiness, this explainability can also provide new insights about the critical factors regarding COVID-19. Finally, we developed a website that takes chest radiology images as input and generates probabilities of the presence of COVID-19 or pneumonia and a heatmap highlighting the probable infected regions.

We aim to assess the management and the outcome of 101 cellular fibroepithelial lesions diagnosed on CNB over a 6-year period in one institution. Consensus on clinical management in each individual patient was reached during multi-disciplinary conferences, based on careful correlation of clinical data with results of imaging studies and pathology of CNB samples. Radiologic findings (mammogram and sonogram) and multiple histologic parameters on CNB specimen were blindly re-evaluated by one experienced breast radiologist and two breast pathologists, respectively, and results were correlated with final diagnosis at excision. Cellular fibroepithelial lesions with indeterminate or suspect imaging findings, with larger size, and with an equivocal comment such as \u201ccannot rule out phyllodes tumor\u201d in the pathology report were excised more frequently (p = 0.05, p = 0.034, and p = 0.01, respectively). Of 43 excised lesions, 13 were classified as benign phyllodes tumors, 23 as fibroadenoma and seven as benign cellular fibroepithelial lesion. The final diagnosis at excision did not significantly correlate with any clinical data, or with retrospective evaluation of imaging findings or comprehensive evaluation of multiple histologic parameters. In 58 patients who had clinical and radiologic follow-up (mean \u00b1 SD: 30 \u00b1 21 months) there was no evidence of disease progression. No clinical and radiologic findings and/or comprehensive evaluation of multiple histologic parameters on CNB specimen are distinctive enough to predict final classification of equivocal cellular fibroepithelial lesions. However, careful clinico-pathologic and radiologic correlation may help to select the most clinically significant lesions for proper immediate surgical management. Follow-up alone may be an appropriate alternative for a subset of patients, given a good clinical, pathologic, and radiologic correlation."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2897980926", "relevance_score": 426.165, "publication_year": 2018, "title": "Radiology Objects in COntext (ROCO): A Multimodal Image Dataset", "cited_by_count": 46, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Context (archaeology)", "level": 2, "score": 0.51568353}, {"display_name": "Artificial intelligence", "level": 1, "score": 0.4442078}, {"display_name": "Image (mathematics)", "level": 2, "score": 0.42260796}, {"display_name": "Computer vision", "level": 1, "score": 0.3946686}, {"display_name": "Medical physics", "level": 1, "score": 0.3509906}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"This": [0], "work": [1], "introduces": [2], "a": [3, 67], "new": [4], "multimodal": [5, 156], "image": [6, 168, 186], "dataset,": [7], "with": [8, 66, 84, 124, 164], "the": [9, 13, 35, 45, 165], "aim": [10], "of": [11, 167, 183], "detecting": [12], "interplay": [14], "between": [15], "visual": [16, 46], "elements": [17], "and": [18, 55, 118, 140, 148, 170, 182, 187], "semantic": [19, 50, 171], "relations": [20], "present": [21], "in": [22, 48, 75, 105], "radiology": [23, 82, 130], "images.": [24], "The": [25], "objective": [26], "is": [27, 135, 180], "accomplished": [28], "by": [29], "retrieving": [30], "all": [31], "image-caption": [32], "pairs": [33], "from": [34, 128], "open-access": [36], "biomedical": [37], "literature": [38], "database": [39], "PubMedCentral,": [40], "as": [41], "these": [42], "captions": [43], "describe": [44], "content": [47], "their": [49], "context.": [51], "All": [52, 103], "compound,": [53], "multi-pane,": [54], "non-radiology": [56], "images": [57, 83, 104, 126], "were": [58], "eliminated": [59], "using": [60, 177], "an": [61], "automatic": [62], "binary": [63], "classifier": [64], "fine-tuned": [65], "deep": [68], "convolutional": [69], "neural": [70], "network": [71], "system.": [72], "Radiology": [73], "Objects": [74], "COntext": [76], "(ROCO)": [77], "dataset": [78], "contains": [79], "over": [80], "81k": [81], "several": [85], "medical": [86], "imaging": [87], "modalities": [88], "including": [89], "Computer": [90], "Tomography,": [91, 97], "Ultrasound,": [92], "X-Ray,": [93], "Fluoroscopy,": [94], "Positron": [95], "Emission": [96], "Mammography,": [98], "Magnetic": [99], "Resonance": [100], "Imaging,": [101], "Angiography.": [102], "ROCO": [106], "have": [107], "corresponding": [108], "caption,": [109], "keywords,": [110], "Unified": [111], "Medical": [112], "Language": [113], "Systems": [114, 163], "Concept": [115], "Unique": [116], "Identifiers": [117], "Semantic": [119], "Type.": [120], "An": [121], "out-of-class": [122], "set": [123], "6k": [125], "ranging": [127], "synthetic": [129], "figures": [131], "to": [132, 137], "digital": [133], "arts": [134], "provided,": [136], "improve": [138], "prediction": [139], "classification": [141], "performance.": [142], "Adopting": [143], "ROCO,": [144, 178], "systems": [145], "for": [146, 158, 185], "caption": [147], "keywords": [149], "generation": [150], "can": [151, 174], "be": [152, 175], "modeled,": [153], "which": [154, 179], "allows": [155], "representation": [157], "datasets": [159], "lacking": [160], "text": [161], "representation.": [162], "goal": [166], "structuring": [169], "information": [172, 188], "tagging": [173], "created": [176], "beneficial": [181], "assistance": [184], "retrieval": [189], "purposes.": [190]}, "authors": ["Obioma Pelka", "Sven Koitka", "Johannes R\u00fcckert", "Felix Nensa", "Christoph M.

The objective is accomplished by retrieving all image-caption pairs from the open-access biomedical literature database PubMedCentral, as these captions describe the visual content in their semantic context. All compound, multi-pane, and non-radiology images were eliminated using an automatic binary classifier fine-tuned with a deep convolutional neural network system. Radiology Objects in COntext (ROCO) dataset contains over 81k radiology images with several medical imaging modalities including Computer Tomography, Ultrasound, X-Ray, Fluoroscopy, Positron Emission Tomography, Mammography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Angiography. All images in ROCO have corresponding caption, keywords, Unified Medical Language Systems Concept Unique Identifiers and Semantic Type.

This system is part of an industrial-strength processing pipeline built to extract content from radiology reports for use in the Victorian Cancer Registry. Materials and methods In addition to traditional supervised learning methods such as conditional random fields and support vector machines, active learning (AL) approaches were investigated to optimize training production and further improve classification performance. The project involved two pilot sites in Victoria, Australia (Lake Imaging (Ballarat) and Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre (Melbourne)) and, in collaboration with the NSW Central Registry, one pilot site at Westmead Hospital (Sydney). Results The reportability classifier performance achieved 98.25% sensitivity and 96.14% specificity on the cancer registry's held-out test set. Up to 92% of training data needed for supervised machine learning can be saved by AL. Discussion AL is a promising method for optimizing the supervised training production used in classification of radiology reports. When an AL strategy is applied during the data selection process, the cost of manual classification can be reduced significantly. Conclusions The most important practical application of the reportability classifier is that it can dramatically reduce human effort in identifying relevant reports from the large imaging pool for further investigation of cancer. The classifier is built on a large real-world dataset and can achieve high performance in filtering relevant reports to support cancer registries."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2156830008", "relevance_score": 291.7546, "publication_year": 2012, "title": "Cystic Lesions of the Pancreas: Radiologic-Endosonographic Correlation", "cited_by_count": 46, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Serous Cystadenoma", "level": 3, "score": 0.8435736}, {"display_name": "Pancreas", "level": 2, "score": 0.7745786}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.6395195}, {"display_name": "Serous fluid", "level": 2, "score": 0.54466826}, {"display_name": "Mucinous cystadenoma", "level": 3, "score": 0.4746445}, {"display_name": "Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm", "level": 3, "score": 0.46326664}, {"display_name": "Cystadenoma", "level": 3, "score": 0.44806919}, {"display_name": "Pathology", "level": 1, "score": 0.4301401}, {"display_name": "Adenocarcinoma", "level": 3, "score": 0.42810196}, {"display_name": "Cyst", "level": 2, "score": 0.41408393}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Cystic": [0, 45], "lesions": [1, 16, 46, 61, 105], "of": [2, 14, 20, 42, 47, 62, 103], "the": [3, 18, 40, 48, 63, 100, 107], "pancreas": [4, 49, 64], "are": [5], "relatively": [6], "common": [7], "findings": [8], "at": [9, 134], "cross-sectional": [10], "imaging;": [11], "however,": [12], "classification": [13], "these": [15, 43, 104], "on": [17], "basis": [19], "imaging": [21, 101], "features": [22, 102], "alone": [23], "can": [24], "sometimes": [25], "be": [26, 37], "difficult.": [27], "Complementary": [28], "evaluation": [29], "with": [30, 99, 117], "endoscopic": [31], "ultrasonography": [32], "and": [33, 56, 76, 80, 95, 106, 119, 128], "fine-needle": [34], "aspiration": [35], "may": [36, 50], "helpful": [38], "in": [39], "diagnosis": [41], "lesions.": [44], "range": [51], "from": [52], "benign": [53], "to": [54, 124], "malignant": [55], "include": [57], "both": [58], "primary": [59], "cystic": [60, 71, 84], "(including": [65, 86], "intraductal": [66], "papillary": [67], "mucinous": [68, 70], "neoplasms,": [69, 72, 91], "serous": [73], "cystadenomas,": [74], "pseudocysts,": [75], "true": [77], "epithelial": [78], "cysts)": [79], "solid": [81, 89], "neoplasms": [82], "undergoing": [83], "degeneration": [85], "neuroendocrine": [87], "tumors,": [88], "pseudopapillary": [90], "and,": [92], "rarely,": [93], "adenocarcinoma": [94], "its": [96], "variants).": [97], "Familiarity": [98], "basic": [108], "treatment": [109], "algorithms": [110], "is": [111, 121], "essential": [112], "for": [113], "radiologists,": [114], "as": [115], "collaboration": [116], "gastroenterologists": [118], "surgeons": [120], "often": [122], "necessary": [123], "obtain": [125], "an": [126], "early": [127], "accurate": [129], "diagnosis.": [130], "Supplemental": [131], "material": [132], "available": [133], "http://radiographics.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/rg.327125019/-/DC1.": [135]}, "authors": ["J Ku\u010dera", "Stephen Kucera", "Scott D.

However, a closer look reveals that imaging plays an important role in the propagation of disparities. For example, many advanced and resource-intensive imaging modalities, such as MRI and PET/CT, are generally less available in the hospitals frequented by people of color, and when they are available, access is impeded due to longer travel and wait times. Furthermore, their images may be of lower quality, and their interpretations may be more error prone. The aggregate effect of these imaging acquisition and interpretation disparities in conjunction with social factors is insufficiently recognized as part of the wide variation in disease outcomes seen between races in America. Understanding the nature of disparities in radiology is important to effectively deploy the resources and expertise necessary to mitigate disparities through diversity and inclusion efforts, research, and advocacy.

Nearly all organs can be affected by immune-related toxicities. However, the most frequently reported are: fatigue, rash, pruritus, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, arthralgia, decreased appetite and abdominal pain. Although these adverse events are usually mild, reversible and not frequent, an early diagnosis is crucial. Immune-related pulmonary toxicity was most frequently observed in trials of lung cancer and of melanoma patients treated with the combination of the anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)-4 and the anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) antibodies. The most frequent immune-related adverse event in the lung is represented by pneumonitis due to the development of infiltrates in the interstitium and in the alveoli. Clinical symptoms and radiological patterns are the key elements to be considered for an early diagnosis, rendering the differential diagnosis crucial. Diagnosis of immune-related pneumonitis may imply the temporary or definitive suspension of immunotherapy, along with the start of immuno-suppressive treatments. The aim of this work is to summarize the biological bases, clinical and radiological findings of lung toxicity under immune checkpoint blockade, underlining the importance of multidisciplinary teams for an optimal early diagnosis of this side effect, with the aim to reach an improved patient care."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2102330924", "relevance_score": 250.48453, "publication_year": 2003, "title": "Variable phenotype in Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome: Clinical and radiological findings in 4 independent families and 3 sporadic cases with identifiedGLI3 mutations", "cited_by_count": 46, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Penetrance", "level": 4, "score": 0.79456824}, {"display_name": "Craniofacial", "level": 2, "score": 0.68612814}, {"display_name": "Missense mutation", "level": 4, "score": 0.67348576}, {"display_name": "Phenotype", "level": 3, "score": 0.6159164}, {"display_name": "Genetics", "level": 1, "score": 0.5755677}, {"display_name": "GLI3", "level": 5, "score": 0.5587434}, {"display_name": "Polydactyly", "level": 2, "score": 0.49741963}, {"display_name": "Clinical phenotype", "level": 4, "score": 0.46412492}, {"display_name": "Genetic counseling", "level": 2, "score": 0.41863286}, {"display_name": "Pediatrics", "level": 1, "score": 0.3272913}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Greig": [0], "cephalopolysyndactyly": [1], "(GCPS)": [2], "(OMIM": [3], "175700)": [4], "is": [5, 78], "an": [6], "autosomal": [7], "dominant": [8], "disorder": [9], "characterized": [10], "by": [11], "a": [12, 57, 74, 82, 87, 96, 99], "distinct": [13], "combination": [14], "of": [15, 28, 65, 89], "craniofacial,": [16], "hand": [17], "and": [18, 25, 38, 53, 72, 80], "foot": [19], "malformations.": [20], "In": [21, 56, 86], "this": [22], "report,": [23], "clinical": [24, 104], "radiological": [26], "findings": [27], "12": [29], "patients": [30], "with": [31, 42, 48], "GCPS": [32, 93, 109], "derived": [33], "from": [34], "4": [35, 66], "independent": [36], "families": [37], "3": [39], "sporadic": [40], "cases": [41], "documented": [43], "GLI3": [44], "mutations": [45], "are": [46], "presented": [47], "particular": [49], "emphasis": [50], "on": [51], "inter-": [52], "intrafamilial": [54], "variability.": [55], "particularly": [58], "instructive": [59], "family": [60], "in": [61], "which": [62], "9": [63], "members": [64], "generations": [67], "could": [68], "be": [69], "studied": [70], "clinically": [71], "molecularly,": [73], "missense": [75], "mutation": [76], "(R625W)": [77], "transmitted": [79], "shows": [81], "partially": [83], "penetrant": [84], "pattern.": [85], "branch": [88], "the": [90, 92], "family,": [91], "phenotype": [94], "skips": [95], "generation": [97], "via": [98], "normal": [100], "female": [101], "carrier": [102], "without": [103], "signs": [105], "providing": [106], "evidence": [107], "that": [108], "does": [110], "not": [111], "always": [112], "manifest": [113], "full": [114], "penetrance": [115], "as": [116], "generally": [117], "supposed.": [118]}, "authors": ["Philippe Debeer", "Hilde Peeters", "S.

baseline chest CT and to quantify the thoracic disease using an artificial intelligence tool and a visual scoring system to predict prognosis in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Materials and methods This study included 103 (41 women and 62 men; 68.8 years of mean age\u2014range, 29\u201393 years) with suspicious COVID-19 viral infection evaluated by reverse transcription real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. All patients underwent CT examinations at the time of admission in addition to clinical and laboratory findings recording. All chest CT examinations were reviewed using a structured report. Moreover, using an artificial intelligence tool we performed an automatic segmentation on CT images based on Hounsfield unit to calculate residual healthy lung parenchyma, ground-glass opacities (GGO), consolidations and emphysema volumes for both right and left lungs. Two expert radiologists, in consensus, attributed at the CT pulmonary disease involvement a severity score using a scale of 5 levels; the score was attributed for GGO and consolidation for each lung, and then, an overall radiological severity visual score was obtained summing the single score. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was performed. Results Symptoms and comorbidities did not show differences statistically significant in terms of patient outcome. Instead, SpO2 was significantly lower in patients hospitalized in critical conditions or died while age, HS CRP, leukocyte count, neutrophils, LDH, d-dimer, troponin, creatinine and azotemia, ALT, AST and bilirubin values were significantly higher. GGO and consolidations were the main CT patterns (a variable combination of GGO and consolidations was found in 87.8% of patients). CT COVID-19 disease was prevalently bilateral (77.6%) with peripheral distribution (74.5%) and multiple lobes localizations (52.0%). Consolidation, emphysema and residual healthy lung parenchyma volumes showed statistically significant differences in the three groups of patients based on outcome (patients discharged at home, patients hospitalized in stable conditions and patient hospitalized in critical conditions or died) while GGO volume did not affect the patient's outcome. Moreover, the overall radiological severity visual score (cutoff \u2265 8) was a predictor of patient outcome. The highest value of R -squared ( R 2 = 0.93) was obtained by the model that combines clinical/laboratory findings at CT volumes. The highest accuracy was obtained by clinical/laboratory and CT findings model with a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy, respectively, of 88%, 78% and 81% to predict discharged/stable patients versus critical/died patients. Conclusion In conclusion, both CT visual score and computerized software-based quantification of the consolidation, emphysema and residual healthy lung parenchyma on chest CT images were independent predictors of outcome in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2171502885", "relevance_score": 358.58945, "publication_year": 2013, "title": "Reliability of radiologic glenohumeral osteoarthritis classifications", "cited_by_count": 45, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Osteoarthritis", "level": 3, "score": 0.7635592}, {"display_name": "Grading (engineering)", "level": 2, "score": 0.65549135}, {"display_name": "Kappa", "level": 2, "score": 0.5532109}, {"display_name": "Radiography", "level": 2, "score": 0.5424304}, {"display_name": "Reliability (semiconductor)", "level": 3, "score": 0.47492534}, {"display_name": "Cohen's kappa", "level": 2, "score": 0.4660989}, {"display_name": "Orthodontics", "level": 1, "score": 0.44834444}, {"display_name": "Nuclear medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.39183426}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.37849635}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"This": [0], "study": [1], "was": [2], "conducted": [3], "to": [4, 64, 133, 145, 162], "determine": [5], "the": [6, 51, 83, 92, 100, 108, 118, 126, 138, 141, 154], "intraobserver": [7, 46, 68], "and": [8, 47, 61, 66, 69, 79, 89, 97, 105, 110, 115, 120, 123, 135, 137, 147, 164, 172], "interobserver": [9, 48, 70], "reliability": [10, 49, 152], "of": [11, 18, 50, 140], "glenohumeral": [12, 27, 157], "osteoarthritis": [13, 28, 158], "classification": [14, 37, 52, 130, 143], "schemes.The": [15], "plain": [16], "radiographs": [17], "108": [19], "shoulder": [20], "joints": [21], "from": [22], "96": [23], "consecutive": [24], "patients": [25], "with": [26, 153], "treated": [29], "at": [30], "our": [31], "institution": [32], "were": [33, 54, 72], "graded": [34], "into": [35], "6": [36], "systems": [38, 131, 160], "by": [39, 56], "2": [40, 43], "observers": [41], "on": [42], "occasions.": [44], "The": [45], "schemes": [53], "determined": [55], "using": [57], "Cohen's": [58], "\u03ba": [59], "coefficient": [60], "weighted": [62], "according": [63, 132, 144, 161], "Landis": [65], "Koch.The": [67], "reliabilities": [71], "0.907": [73], "(observer": [74, 77], "1),": [75], "0.965": [76], "2),": [78], "0.851": [80], "(interobserver)": [81], "for": [82, 91, 99, 107, 117, 125, 170], "Samilson-Prieto": [84, 142, 163], "grading": [85, 128, 159], "system;": [86], "0.954,": [87], "0.948,": [88], "0.869": [90], "Allain": [93, 146], "modification;": [94, 102], "0.936,": [95], "0.830,": [96], "0.791": [98], "Gerber": [101, 148], "0.887,": [103], "0.892,": [104], "0.744": [106], "Kellgren": [109], "Lawrence": [111], "classification;": [112], "0.873,": [113], "0.964,": [114], "0.935": [116], "Weinstein;": [119], "0.854,": [121], "0.934,": [122], "0.797": [124], "Guyette": [127, 136], "system.The": [129], "Weinstein": [134], "modifications": [139], "showed": [149], "a": [150], "comparable": [151], "commonly": [155], "used": [156], "Kellgren-Lawrence.": [165], "Thus,": [166], "they": [167], "are": [168], "recommended": [169], "clinical": [171], "especially": [173], "scientific": [174], "purposes.": [175]}, "authors": ["Mohammed Elsharkawi", "Balkan Cakir", "Heiko Reichel", "Thomas Kappe"], "abstract": "This study was conducted to determine the intraobserver and interobserver reliability of glenohumeral osteoarthritis classification schemes.The plain radiographs of 108 shoulder joints from 96 consecutive patients with glenohumeral osteoarthritis treated at our institution were graded into 6 classification systems by 2 observers on 2 occasions.

The accuracy of the forecast plume is highly dependent on the source term estimation. On several academic test cases, including real data, inverse modelling and data assimilation techniques were proven to help in the assessment of the source term. In this paper, a semi-automatic method is proposed for the sequential reconstruction of the plume, by implementing a sequential data assimilation algorithm based on inverse modelling, with a care to develop realistic methods for operational risk agencies. The performance of the assimilation scheme has been assessed through the intercomparison between French and Finnish frameworks. Two dispersion models have been used: Polair3D and Silam developed in two different research centres. Different release locations, as well as different meteorological situations are tested. The existing and newly planned surveillance networks are used and realistically large multiplicative observational errors are assumed. The inverse modelling scheme accounts for strong error bias encountered with such errors. The efficiency of the data assimilation system is tested via statistical indicators. For France and Finland, the average performance of the data assimilation system is strong. However there are outlying situations where the inversion fails because of a too poor observability. In addition, in the case where the power plant responsible for the accidental release is not known, robust statistical tools are developed and tested to discriminate candidate release sites."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2027677756", "relevance_score": 284.14758, "publication_year": 2011, "title": "Automated Detection of Critical Results in Radiology Reports", "cited_by_count": 45, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Precision and recall", "level": 2, "score": 0.52205276}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.5160615}, {"display_name": "Data mining", "level": 1, "score": 0.3592717}, {"display_name": "Medical physics", "level": 1, "score": 0.35301578}, {"display_name": "Artificial intelligence", "level": 1, "score": 0.34556776}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"The": [0, 51, 139], "goal": [1], "of": [2, 109, 120, 143, 157], "this": [3], "study": [4], "was": [5, 125], "to": [6, 12, 60, 149, 167, 186], "develop": [7], "and": [8, 46, 49, 58, 65, 87, 101, 113, 130, 155, 159, 174, 182, 184], "validate": [9], "text-mining": [10, 75], "algorithms": [11, 52, 98, 145, 163], "automatically": [13], "identify": [14], "radiology": [15, 68, 111, 168], "reports": [16, 69, 115], "containing": [17], "critical": [18, 72], "results": [19], "including": [20], "tension": [21], "or": [22, 42], "increasing/new": [23], "large": [24], "pneumothorax,": [25], "acute": [26, 29, 31], "pulmonary": [27], "embolism,": [28], "cholecystitis,": [30], "appendicitis,": [32], "ectopic": [33], "pregnancy,": [34], "scrotal": [35], "torsion,": [36], "unexplained": [37], "free": [38], "intraperitoneal": [39], "air,": [40], "new": [41], "increasing": [43], "intracranial": [44], "hemorrhage,": [45], "malpositioned": [47], "tubes": [48], "lines.": [50], "were": [53, 77], "developed": [54], "using": [55, 127, 132], "rule-based": [56], "approaches": [57], "designed": [59], "search": [61], "for": [62, 171, 180, 189], "common": [63], "words": [64], "phrases": [66], "in": [67], "that": [70], "indicate": [71], "results.": [73], "Certain": [74], "features": [76], "utilized": [78, 99], "such": [79], "as": [80, 135], "wildcards,": [81], "stemming,": [82], "negation": [83], "detection,": [84], "proximity": [85], "matching,": [86], "expanded": [88], "searches": [89], "with": [90, 116, 151, 177], "applicable": [91], "synonyms.": [92], "To": [93], "further": [94], "improve": [95], "accuracy,": [96], "the": [97, 106, 110, 136, 144], "modality": [100], "exam-specific": [102], "queries,": [103], "searched": [104], "under": [105], "\u201cImpression\u201d": [107], "field": [108], "report,": [112], "excluded": [114], "a": [117, 152], "low": [118], "level": [119], "diagnostic": [121], "certainty.": [122], "Algorithm": [123], "accuracy": [124, 141], "determined": [126], "precision,": [128], "recall,": [129], "F-measure": [131], "human": [133], "review": [134], "reference": [137], "standard.": [138], "overall": [140], "(F-measure)": [142], "ranged": [146], "from": [147], "81%": [148], "100%,": [150], "mean": [153], "precision": [154], "recall": [156], "96%": [158], "91%,": [160], "respectively.": [161], "These": [162], "can": [164], "be": [165], "applied": [166], "report": [169], "databases": [170], "quality": [172], "assurance": [173], "accreditation,": [175], "integrated": [176], "existing": [178], "dashboards": [179], "display": [181], "monitoring,": [183], "ported": [185], "other": [187], "institutions": [188], "their": [190], "own": [191], "use.": [192]}, "authors": ["Paras Lakhani", "Woojin Kim", "Curtis P.

Certain text-mining features were utilized such as wildcards, stemming, negation detection, proximity matching, and expanded searches with applicable synonyms. To further improve accuracy, the algorithms utilized modality and exam-specific queries, searched under the \u201cImpression\u201d field of the radiology report, and excluded reports with a low level of diagnostic certainty. Algorithm accuracy was determined using precision, recall, and F-measure using human review as the reference standard. The overall accuracy (F-measure) of the algorithms ranged from 81% to 100%, with a mean precision and recall of 96% and 91%, respectively.

Purpose: To validate the grading of the NY criteria in CT of the sacroiliac joints. Material and Methods: With the aid of the NY criteria, assessment of inflammatory and degenerative changes was made in 1304 CT studies. Assessment included erosions, the distribution, type, and width of sclerosis, and the involvement of the joints in sacroiliitis, as well as of normal anatomic variants such as joint space width and shape. Results: There was definite radiological sacroiliitis in 420 joints in 251 patients. Among these, more than two-thirds of the joint was involved in 71.0% of the affected joints. Sclerosis of the ilium was much more prevalent than sacral sclerosis. With increasing NY grade, iliac sclerosis, width, and extent increased, transition from sclerosis to normal bone became indistinct, and the structure of sclerosis was more inhomogeneous. Erosions of the joint surfaces were localized predominantly on the iliac side. Conclusion: Only erosions seem to be a valid solitary diagnostic sign. Solitary erosions need supplemental evidence from other inflammatory signs. Inflammatory sclerosis may be distinguished from degenerative sclerosis, and can sometimes support early diagnosis. Joint space width, joint shape, bone mineral content, or enthesopathy have no place in sacroiliitis diagnosis on CT. The NY criteria are not ideal for use with CT. A practical classification of sacroiliitis on CT is proposed, with a grading of no disease, suspected disease, and definite disease."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2163946228", "relevance_score": 230.36829, "publication_year": 2012, "title": "Progression of acromegalic arthropathy despite long-term biochemical control: a prospective, radiological study", "cited_by_count": 45, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Acromegaly", "level": 4, "score": 0.9362783}, {"display_name": "Arthropathy", "level": 4, "score": 0.7375551}, {"display_name": "Prospective cohort study", "level": 2, "score": 0.7199348}, {"display_name": "Internal medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.63485086}, {"display_name": "Osteoarthritis", "level": 3, "score": 0.57767105}, {"display_name": "Odds ratio", "level": 2, "score": 0.43679684}, {"display_name": "Surgery", "level": 1, "score": 0.37159395}, {"display_name": "Endocrinology", "level": 1, "score": 0.33905786}, {"display_name": "Pathology", "level": 1, "score": 0.26081836}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Arthropathy": [0], "is": [1, 235], "an": [2], "invalidating": [3], "complication": [4], "of": [5, 7, 22, 32, 39, 44, 73, 78, 104, 127, 137, 157, 167, 178], "acromegaly,": [6], "which": [8], "the": [9, 20, 23, 29, 84, 105, 112, 179, 232, 252], "prognosis": [10], "and": [11, 42, 108, 116, 129, 135, 174, 192, 201, 251], "determinants": [12, 43], "are": [13], "currently": [14], "unknown": [15], "in": [16, 46, 94, 133], "treated": [17], "acromegaly.": [18], "Therefore,": [19], "objective": [21], "present": [24, 233], "study": [25, 57, 114, 234], "was": [26, 81, 131, 182, 223], "to": [27, 248], "investigate": [28], "radiographic": [30], "progression": [31, 77, 124, 156, 227], "arthropathy": [33], "over": [34], "a": [35, 54, 71, 91, 237], "mean": [36, 72], "follow-up": [37, 52], "period": [38], "2.6": [40, 118], "years": [41], "outcome": [45], "patients": [47, 61, 138, 162, 197], "with": [48, 67, 147, 213, 225], "long-term,": [49], "well-controlled": [50], "acromegaly.Prospective": [51], "study.In": [53], "prospective": [55], "cohort": [56], "we": [58], "studied": [59], "58": [60], "(mean": [62], "age": [63, 141, 191], "62,": [64], "women": [65], "41%)": [66], "controlled": [68, 239], "acromegaly": [69], "for": [70, 123, 143, 185, 254], "17.6": [74], "years.": [75, 119], "Radiographic": [76], "joint": [79, 95, 215], "disease": [80], "defined": [82], "by": [83, 150, 220], "Osteoarthritis": [85], "Research": [86], "Society": [87], "International": [88], "classification": [89], "as": [90, 188], "1-point": [92], "increase": [93], "space": [96], "narrowing": [97], "(JSN)": [98], "or": [99], "osteophyte": [100, 144], "scores": [101], "on": [102], "radiographs": [103], "hands,": [106], "knees,": [107], "hips": [109], "obtained": [110], "at": [111], "first": [113], "visit": [115], "after": [117], "Potential": [120], "risk": [121], "factors": [122], "were": [125, 189, 211], "assessed.Progression": [126], "osteophytes": [128], "JSN": [130, 186, 200], "observed": [132], "72": [134], "74%": [136], "respectively.": [139], "Higher": [140], "predisposed": [142], "progression.": [145], "Patients": [146], "biochemical": [148, 205, 218], "control": [149, 219, 246], "somatostatin": [151], "(SMS)": [152], "analogs": [153, 222], "had": [154], "more": [155, 226, 255], "osteophytosis": [158], "than": [159, 228], "surgically": [160], "cured": [161], "(odds": [163], "ratio=18.9,": [164], "P=0.025),": [165], "independent": [166], "age,": [168], "sex,": [169], "BMI,": [170], "baseline": [171, 194], "IGF1": [172, 195], "SDS": [173], "exon": [175], "3": [176], "deletion": [177], "GHR.": [180], "This": [181], "also": [183], "evident": [184], "progression,": [187], "higher": [190, 193], "SDS.Acromegalic": [196], "have": [198], "progressive": [199, 214], "osteophytosis,": [202], "despite": [203], "long-term": [204], "control.": [206], "Parameters": [207], "reflecting": [208], "GH/IGF1": [209], "activity": [210], "associated": [212, 224], "disease.": [216], "Remarkably,": [217], "SMS": [221], "surgical": [229], "cure.": [230], "Although": [231], "not": [236], "randomized": [238], "trial,": [240], "this": [241], "may": [242], "indicate": [243], "insufficient": [244], "GH": [245], "according": [247], "current": [249], "criteria": [250], "need": [253], "aggressive": [256], "therapy.": [257]}, "authors": ["Kim M J A Claessen", "Sharita R.

Therefore, the objective of the present study was to investigate the radiographic progression of arthropathy over a mean follow-up period of 2.6 years and determinants of outcome in patients with long-term, well-controlled acromegaly.Prospective follow-up study.In a prospective cohort study we studied 58 patients (mean age 62, women 41%) with controlled acromegaly for a mean of 17.6 years. Radiographic progression of joint disease was defined by the Osteoarthritis Research Society International classification as a 1-point increase in joint space narrowing (JSN) or osteophyte scores on radiographs of the hands, knees, and hips obtained at the first study visit and after 2.6 years. Potential risk factors for progression were assessed.Progression of osteophytes and JSN was observed in 72 and 74% of patients respectively. Higher age predisposed for osteophyte progression. Patients with biochemical control by somatostatin (SMS) analogs had more progression of osteophytosis than surgically cured patients (odds ratio=18.9, P=0.025), independent of age, sex, BMI, baseline IGF1 SDS and exon 3 deletion of the GHR. This was also evident for JSN progression, as were higher age and higher baseline IGF1 SDS.Acromegalic patients have progressive JSN and osteophytosis, despite long-term biochemical control. Parameters reflecting GH/IGF1 activity were associated with progressive joint disease. Remarkably, biochemical control by SMS analogs was associated with more progression than surgical cure. Although the present study is not a randomized controlled trial, this may indicate insufficient GH control according to current criteria and the need for more aggressive therapy."}, {"id":

In 1996, the Institute of Medicine launched a concerted, ongoing effort focused on assessing and improving the quality of health care in this country. Although many of us who practice in academic medical centers have always assumed that we practice the highest quality medicine, we have neither consistently defined the concept nor systematically measured the quality of our practice. In 1999, the Institute of Medicine [1To err is human: building a safer health system. National Academy Press, Washington, DC1999Google Scholar] released a report titled To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System. The report showed that tens of thousands of Americans die each year from medical errors and put the issues of patient safety and quality on the radar screen of public and private policymakers. A subsequent report in 2001, titled Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century [2Institute of MedicineCrossing the quality chasm: a new health system for the 21st century. National Academy Press, Washington, DC2001Google Scholar], described broader quality issues and defined 6 goals for improvement, 10 guidelines for health care delivery redesign, and 4 proposals to change the environment. One of the 4 proposals to change the environment is to align payment policies with quality improvement. The idea of providing a higher reimbursement rate for physicians who meet established performance and quality criteria also was promoted in a 2005 publication of the National Academy of Science [3Nass S, Ball J. Improving breast imaging quality standards. Available at: http://www.nap.edu/openbook/0309096480/html/2.html.Google Scholar] titled Improving Breast Imaging Quality Standards. In response to these reports and to public pressure, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations [4Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations. 2007 pre-publication management of human resources standards for hospitals. Available at: http://www.jointcommission.org/AccreditationPrograms/Hospitals/Standards/prepub_stds.htm.Google Scholar] has introduced new hospital standards and processes for the granting of hospital privileges. Specifically, each hospital must have an ongoing professional practice evaluation program that includes the following characteristics:1a clearly defined process to facilitate evaluation of each practitioner\u2019s professional practice;2data collected to be department specific and approved by the medical staff; and3data collected to be used to determine whether to continue, limit, or revoke existing privileges. The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations recommends that each hospital collect data on 6 major areas (outcomes of operative and other procedures, patterns of drug and blood use, requests for tests and procedures, length-of-stay patterns, morbidity and mortality data, and the use of consultants) for each individual physician to facilitate professional practice evaluation. Although these parameters are useful for assessing the practice quality of an internist, a surgeon, and, to some extent, an interventional radiologist, they are of little use for monitoring the quality of a diagnostic radiologist\u2019s practice. According to the Institute of Medicine [1To err is human: building a safer health system. National Academy Press, Washington, DC1999Google Scholar], quality is defined as \u201cthe degree to which health services for individuals and populations increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes and are consistent with current professional knowledge.\u201d To patients, a good radiology practice provides easy scheduling, no unnecessary waiting, a clean facility, easy parking, and friendly personnel [5Lexa F.J. 300,000 customers: patient perspectives on service and quality.J Am Coll Radiol. 2006; 3: 346-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar]. To referring clinicians, a good radiologist is one who is accessible, recommends appropriate imaging studies, and provides timely consultation and reports with high interpretation accuracy. This paper focuses on 3 fundamental questions related to the quality management of interpretation accuracy: what to measure, what standards to use, and how to measure it. Quality management in breast imaging serves as a good model for an entire radiology department to follow. The Mammography Quality Standards Act requires that mammography facilities track their performance by obtaining outcome data on women recommended for breast biopsy on the basis of abnormal mammographic findings (positive predictive value) for individual mammographers. At a recent conference, Improving Breast Image Quality Standards 2005 [3Nass S, Ball J. Improving breast imaging quality standards. Available at: http://www.nap.edu/openbook/0309096480/html/2.html.Google Scholar], the recommendation was made to expand the medical audit component of the legislation to track data on 3 core parameters (instead of 1) for each mammographer:1positive predictive value 2, or the proportion of women recommended for biopsy\u2014BI-RADS\u00ae 4, 5\u2014who are subsequently diagnosed with breast cancer;2the cancer detection rate per 1,000 women; and3the abnormal interpretation rate, or mammographic interpretations that lead to women\u2019s undergoing additional imaging or biopsies. Although these parameters are mandated for mammography practice, they clearly can be useful to other radiology subspecialties as well. This is especially true when studies are performed for defined clinical problems (eg, computed tomographic studies to exclude acute appendicitis). However, the same 3 parameters would be of less value for assessing the interpretation accuracy of studies that are obtained for vague and general clinical problems (eg, diffuse abdominal pain or headache) in patients with no pathologic proof or adequate clinical follow-up. For the latter group of patients, which constitutes a large percentage at my practice, we have elected to measure the concordance (the percentage of agreement) and discordance (the percentage of disagreement) of original interpretations within a peer group. In cases of discordance, difference is further categorized into major and minor. The error rate among radiologists is reported to hover around 30% [6Berlin L. Reporting the \u201cmissed\u201d radiologic diagnosis: medicolegal and ethical considerations.Radiology. 1994; 192: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar]. However, to the best of my knowledge, there are no published benchmark data regarding interpretation accuracy for either general or subspecialty radiologists. Informal surveys among my section chiefs indicate that most use a miss rate of 10% and a concordant interpretation rate of 90% as their internal benchmarks. The development of national benchmarks for interpretation accuracy, similar to that in screening mammography, would be desirable. To have a successful quality management or peer-review process in radiology, the method must be reliable, robust, consistent, and easy to follow. The ideal methodology should yield maximal useful data with minimal additional manual labor. The adoption of a standardized or structured radiology report similar to that used in screening mammography would facilitate automatic or computerized data mining for quality assessment purposes. Traditionally, quality management in radiology has been reactive. Data on interpretation accuracy are usually obtained through monthly risk management reports, reviews of sentinel events, and monthly imaging-pathologic correlation conferences. With the impending change in the requirements of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations for granting physician privileges, the review process must now be proactive and continuous. In addition to determining interpretation accuracy (positive predictive value, disease detection rates, abnormal interpretation rates) for studies with pathologic or outcome data for individual radiologists, we plan to have regular peer review of randomly selected cases (those without pathologic proof or adequate follow-up) for each subspecialty. Every quarter, 20 cases previously interpreted by a radiologist will be randomly selected by film management personnel and submitted for review by another member of the same section. The reviewer will compare the new findings with the original interpretation and score them as \u201cagree\u201d or \u201cdisagree.\u201d In addition, the reviewer will score the level of disagreement on a 5-point scale, with 1 being not significant and 5 being highly significant, causing a delay in diagnosis (false-negative results), unwarranted invasive procedures (false-positive results), or incorrect treatment. If there is significant disagreement between the original reader and the reviewer, the case will then be blindly reviewed by a third member of the section. Results for each radiologist will be tabulated and held in a protected file. All cases of disagreement will also be batch reviewed (without the original reader\u2019s name) by the entire section each quarter for educational purposes. If the 10% error threshold is exceeded by an individual radiologist in 3 of any 4 consecutive quarters, counseling and educational resources for remediation will be suggested by either the section chief or the department chair. In some of our sections, the group reviews a list of predetermined cases (eg, all cases that are recommended for biopsy in mammography and interesting and difficult cases in neuroradiology) each week. The initial interpretation is correlated either with the final pathologic diagnosis or the consensus opinion of the group in the absence of histologic or surgical confirmation. Interpretive errors and disagreements are recorded and analyzed each quarter for each radiologist. Another approach to the continuous professional practice evaluation is to use the ACR\u2019s RADPEER\u00ae system. This is a simple, cost-effective process that allows peer review to be performed during the routine interpretation of current studies. During the interpretation of a new examination, most radiologists will review prior relevant studies for comparison, if available. The radiologist will then decide whether they agree with the prior interpretation on a standardized 4-point rating scale. The process requires no additional interpretative work on the part of the radiologist beyond what is currently being performed. Both the institution and each participating radiologist are assigned a unique identifier. After the submission of practice data to the ACR, the department will receive quarterly reports detailing the following:1summary statistics and comparisons for each participating radiologist by modality;2summary data for the facility by modality; and3data summarized across all participating facilities by modality. Both a paper version and an electronic Web-based program are available. The program is administered by the ACR for an annual administrative fee that varies with the size of the group. As a group, physicians enjoy their independence and resent excessive government regulations to interfere with their medical practice. Unfortunately, a significant percentage of our faculty members view this latest requirement of continuous professional evaluation not as a means to improve medical care but as a time-consuming bureaucratic process to create more paperwork. Furthermore, physicians are often reluctant to document their colleagues\u2019 mistakes on the record. Besides faculty reluctance, several other issues need to be recognized and addressed before the initiation of any program to manage interpretation accuracy. First, a majority of cases that undergo peer review will have neither pathologic or surgical confirmation nor adequate clinical follow-up. In these cases, determination of the truth will be difficult, and the assessment of disagreement in interpretations will be subjective. We have elected to review these cases by at least 2 independent reviewers or discuss these cases in group sessions to arrive at consensus readings. Although this has not been a problem for most of our sections, it clearly would be difficult to conduct such an independent review process if the section has only 2 or fewer faculty members. Second, it is relatively easy to determine the correctness of an original interpretation if the report is succinct and definitive. However, it is more difficult to determine the accuracy of an interpretation when the report is lengthy and contains a long list of differential diagnoses with equivocation. The universal acceptance of a standardized, structured report similar to that used in screening mammography would clearly facilitate an ongoing peer-review process. Third, the assignment of false-positive cases needs to be refined, even in screening mammography programs. Currently, if a radiologist recommends a follow-up study to ensure the benignity of a detected abnormality, but the surgeon elects to perform a biopsy of the abnormality, a false-positive interpretation will be assigned to the radiologist even if the subsequent biopsy confirms the lesion to be noncancerous. Last but not least, the number of cases selected for our regular review is small and may not achieve statistical significance. This was done primarily to minimize the additional workload for each faculty member and facilitate faculty buy-in of the review process. It may be necessary to increase the number of cases selected for review in the future and vary the number on the basis of individual faculty members\u2019 caseloads. Acknowledging these limitations and potential challenges, I strongly believe that a robust and fair peer-review process that can be efficiently executed would reduce interpretation errors, improve patient safety and outcomes, and facilitate the identification of areas in which individual radiologists may wish to receive additional education. We should not view this process as a punitive bureaucratic intrusion in which Big Brother is running wild but use it as an opportunity to improve patient care.

In this paper, we study the lesion description or annotation problem. Given a lesion image, our aim is to predict a comprehensive set of relevant labels, such as the lesion's body part, type, and attributes, which may assist downstream fine-grained diagnosis. To address this task, we first design a deep learning module to extract relevant semantic labels from the radiology reports associated with the lesion images. With the images and text-mined labels, we propose a lesion annotation network (LesaNet) based on a multilabel convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn all labels holistically. Hierarchical relations and mutually exclusive relations between the labels are leveraged to improve the label prediction accuracy. The relations are utilized in a label expansion strategy and a relational hard example mining algorithm. We also attach a simple score propagation layer on LesaNet to enhance recall and explore implicit relation between labels. Multilabel metric learning is combined with classification to enable interpretable prediction. We evaluated LesaNet on the public DeepLesion dataset, which contains over 32K diverse lesion images. Experiments show that LesaNet can precisely annotate the lesions using an ontology of 171 fine-grained labels with an average AUC of 0.9344."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2058308393", "relevance_score": 169.40166, "publication_year": 2007, "title": "What's new in target volume definition for radiologists in ICRU Report 71?

For the smaller set of 200 reports, 80% were structured successfully with an accuracy rate of 97%.The schema is a formal representation for clinical concepts in radiology reports, and provides domain coverage that is particularly well-suited for natural-language processing of radiology for use in a decision support system."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W3126875379", "relevance_score": 262.2266, "publication_year": 2021, "title": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) detection from chest radiology images using convolutional neural networks", "cited_by_count": 44, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Convolutional neural network", "level": 2, "score": 0.8137125}, {"display_name": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)", "level": 4, "score": 0.72395885}, {"display_name": "Artificial intelligence", "level": 1, "score": 0.58652055}, {"display_name": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)", "level": 5, "score": 0.44431472}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.4355069}, {"display_name": "Computed tomography", "level": 2, "score": 0.4274112}, {"display_name": "Pattern recognition (psychology)", "level": 2, "score": 0.4231186}, {"display_name": "Medical physics", "level": 1, "score": 0.32062912}, {"display_name": "Disease", "level": 2, "score": 0.21041688}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Coronavirus": [0], "disease": [1, 33], "(Covid-19)": [2], "has": [3, 143], "been": [4, 144, 167], "spreading": [5], "all": [6, 89], "over": [7], "the": [8, 23, 198], "world": [9], "and": [10, 42, 55, 120, 149, 181, 193], "its": [11, 35, 66], "diagnosis": [12], "is": [13, 20, 187, 194], "attracting": [14], "more": [15], "research": [16], "every": [17], "moment.": [18], "It": [19], "need": [21], "of": [22, 109, 135, 157], "hour": [24], "to": [25, 101], "develop": [26], "automated": [27], "methods,": [28, 130], "which": [29], "could": [30], "detect": [31], "this": [32], "at": [34, 80, 197], "early": [36], "stage,": [37], "in": [38, 77, 88], "a": [39, 150, 190], "non-invasive": [40], "way": [41], "within": [43], "lesser": [44], "time.": [45], "Currently,": [46], "medical": [47, 110], "specialists": [48], "are": [49, 75, 86, 126], "analyzing": [50], "Computed": [51], "Tomography": [52], "(CT),": [53], "X-Ray,": [54], "Ultrasound": [56], "(US)": [57], "images": [58], "or": [59], "conducting": [60], "Polymerase": [61], "Chain": [62], "Reaction": [63], "(PCR)": [64], "for": [65, 123], "confirmation": [67], "on": [68, 173, 189], "manual": [69], "basis.": [70], "In": [71], "Pakistan,": [72], "CT": [73], "scanners": [74], "available": [76, 87, 148], "most": [78], "hospitals": [79], "district": [81], "level,": [82], "while": [83], "X-Ray": [84], "machines": [85], "tehsil": [90], "(large": [91], "urban": [92], "towns)": [93], "level": [94], "hospitals.": [95], "Being": [96], "widely": [97], "used": [98, 196], "imaging": [99], "modalities": [100], "analyze": [102], "chest": [103], "related": [104], "diseases,": [105], "produce": [106], "large": [107, 191], "volume": [108], "data": [111], "each": [112], "moment": [113], "clinical": [114], "environments.": [115], "Since": [116], "automatic,": [117], "time": [118], "efficient": [119], "reliable": [121], "methods": [122], "Covid-19": [124, 136], "detection": [125, 137], "required": [127], "as": [128], "alternate": [129], "therefore": [131], "an": [132], "automatic": [133], "method": [134, 171], "using": [138], "Convolutional": [139], "Neural": [140], "Networks": [141], "(CNN)": [142], "proposed.": [145], "Three": [146], "publically": [147], "locally": [151], "developed": [152], "dataset,": [153], "obtained": [154], "from": [155], "Department": [156], "Radiology": [158, 199], "(Diagnostics),": [159], "Bahawal": [160], "Victoria": [161], "Hospital,": [162], "Bahawalpur": [163], "(BVHB),": [164, 201], "Pakistan": [165], "have": [166], "used.": [168], "The": [169], "proposed": [170], "achieved": [172], "average": [174], "accuracy": [175], "(96.68": [176], "%),": [177, 180], "specificity": [178], "(95.65": [179], "sensitivity": [182], "(96.24": [183], "%).": [184], "Proposed": [185], "model": [186], "trained": [188], "dataset": [192], "being": [195], "Department,": [200], "Pakistan.": [202]}, "authors": ["Ghulam Gilanie", "Usama Ijaz Bajwa", "Mustansar Mahmood Waraich", "Mutyyba Asghar", "Rehana Kousar", "Adnan Kashif", "Rabab Shereen Aslam", "Muhammad Qasim", "Hamza Rafique"], "abstract": "Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has been spreading all over the world and its diagnosis is attracting more research every moment.

The aim of this study was to create an accurate staging of diverticulitis, which could be used both preoperatively and intraoperatively to predict outcome and guide treatment. METHODS This was a retrospective study of patients treated for diverticulitis in a secondary and tertiary referral center. Multivariate analysis was performed on several clinical, radiologic, and physiologic parameters to find predictors of mortality, need for surgery, need for intensive care, and length of stay. RESULTS A total of 631 patients were analyzed. Organ dysfunction, peritonitis, and abscess size greater than 6 cm were identified as independent predictors of poor outcome. Pericolic air or no extraluminal air predicted better outcome. Based on these factors, a five-grade staging was created as follows: Stage 1, uncomplicated diverticulitis; Stage 2, complicated diverticulitis with small abscess (<6 cm); Stage 3, complicated diverticulitis with large abscess (\u22656 cm) or distant intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal air; Stage 4, Generalized peritonitis without organ dysfunction; Stage 5, generalized peritonitis with organ dysfunction. Mortality was 0, 1%, 3%, 4%, and 32%; need for surgery was 1%, 5%, 46%, 98%, and 100%; and need for intensive care was 0%, 0%, 8%, 11%, and 50%, in Stages 1 to 5, respectively. New staging showed better predictive ability of outcomes compared with earlier classifications in receiver operating characteristic curve analyses. CONCLUSION The proposed staging can be used on all patients both preoperatively and intraoperatively. It takes into account organ dysfunction, which has major influence on survival. The new staging may be easily implemented in daily clinical practice and incorporated in clinical trials.

Hyperglycaemia, hypoglycaemia, hypokalaemia, hyperkalaemia, hyperchloraemia, hypochloraemia and hyponatraemia were among the electrolytic and haematologic disorders (hyperglycaemia 48.00%, hypoglycaemia 6.40%). There were also electrocardiographic abnormalities. Asthma, although usually a late complication, was also noted at the beginning of treatment. Mortality rates were 8.98% for children and 9.6% for adults. Since hypoglycaemia was found in all the patients who died, it was accepted as an ominous prognostic sign.

The issue of representing clinical document content remains problematic. The authors' prior work using an automated UMLS document indexing system has been encouraging but has been affected by the generally low indexing precision of such systems. In an effort to improve precision, the authors have developed a context-sensitive document indexing model to calculate the optimal subset of UMLS source vocabularies used to index each document section. This pilot study was performed to evaluate the utility of this indexing approach on a set of clinical radiology reports.A set of clinical radiology reports that had been indexed manually using UMLS concept descriptors was indexed automatically by the SAPHIRE indexing engine. Using the data generated by this process the authors developed a system that simulated indexing, at the document section level, of the same document set using many permutations of a subset of the UMLS constituent vocabularies.The precision and recall scores generated by simulated indexing for each permutation of two or three UMLS constituent vocabularies were determined.While there was considerable variation in precision and recall values across the different subtypes of radiology reports, the overall effect of this indexing strategy using the best combination of two or three UMLS constituent vocabularies was an improvement in precision without significant impact of recall.In this pilot study a contextual indexing strategy improved overall precision in a set of clinical radiology reports."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2108824290", "relevance_score": 209.60533, "publication_year": 2009, "title": "Comparative Effectiveness Research: What It Means for Radiology",

An evidence-based analysis of published radiologic criteria for assessing spinal canal compromise and cord compression in patients with acute cervical spinal cord injury. Objectives. This study was conducted to determine whether literature-based guidelines could be established for accurate and objective assessment of spinal canal compromise and spinal cord compression after cervical spinal cord injury. Summary of Background Data. Before conducting multicenter trials to determine the efficacy of surgical decompression in cervical spinal cord injury, reliable and objective radiographic criteria to define and quantify spinal cord compression must be established. Methods. A computer-based search of the published English, German, and French language literature from 1966 through 1997 was performed using MEDLINE (U.S. National Library of Medicine database) to identify studies in which cervical spinal canal and cord size were radiographically assessed in a quantitative manner. Thirty-seven references were included for critical analysis. Results. Most studies dealt with degenerative disease, spondylosis, and stenosis; only 13 included patients with acute cervical spinal cord injury. Standard lateral radiographs were the most frequent imaging method used (23 studies). T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging were used to assess spinal cord compression in only 7 and 4 studies, respectively. Spinal cord size or compression were not precisely measured in any of the cervical trauma studies. Interobserver or intraobserver reliability of the radiologic measurements was assessed in only 7 (19%) of the 37 studies. Conclusions. To date, there are few quantitative, reliable radiologic outcome measures for assessing spinal canal compromise or cord compression in patients with acute cervical spinal cord injury."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W1986126376", "relevance_score": 273.2104, "publication_year": 2008, "title": "Gestalt Theory: Implications for Radiology Education", "cited_by_count": 43, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Gestalt psychology", "level": 3, "score": 0.9651977}, {"display_name": "Perception", "level": 2, "score": 0.63973737}, {"display_name": "Variety (cybernetics)", "level": 2, "score": 0.59385014}, {"display_name": "Component (thermodynamics)", "level": 2, "score": 0.5791048}, {"display_name": "Closure (psychology)", "level": 2, "score": 0.5034794}, {"display_name": "Cognitive psychology", "level": 1, "score": 0.47392923}, {"display_name": "Similarity (geometry)", "level": 3, "score": 0.43703824}, {"display_name": "Cognitive science", "level": 1, "score": 0.38736936}, {"display_name": "Epistemology", "level": 1, "score": 0.38247386}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"The": [0], "Gestalt": [1, 39, 65, 134], "theory": [2], "of": [3, 33, 43, 58, 73, 78, 103, 123, 133, 138], "modern": [4], "psychology": [5], "is": [6, 28], "grounded": [7], "in": [8, 89, 95, 110, 141], "the": [9, 21, 25, 31, 38, 61, 101, 107], "ideas": [10], "that": [11, 24], "holistic": [12], "rather": [13, 49], "than": [14, 30, 50], "atomistic": [15], "approaches": [16], "are": [17, 87], "necessary": [18], "to": [19, 46, 93, 128], "understand": [20], "mind,": [22], "and": [23, 70, 85, 97, 106, 146], "mental": [26], "whole": [27], "greater": [29], "sum": [32], "its": [34, 47], "component": [35], "parts.": [36], "Although": [37], "school": [40], "fell": [41], "out": [42], "favor": [44], "due": [45], "descriptive": [48], "explanatory": [51], "nature,": [52], "it": [53], "permanently": [54], "changed": [55], "our": [56], "understanding": [57], "perception.": [59], "For": [60], "radiologist,": [62], "such": [63], "fundamental": [64], "concepts": [66], "as": [67], "figure-ground": [68], "relationships": [69], "a": [71, 116], "variety": [72], "\"grouping": [74], "principles\"": [75], "(the": [76], "laws": [77], "closure,": [79], "proximity,": [80], "similarity,": [81], "common": [82], "region,": [83], "continuity,": [84], "symmetry)": [86], "ubiquitous": [88], "daily": [90], "work,": [91], "not": [92], "mention": [94], "art": [96], "personal": [98], "life.By": [99], "considering": [100], "applications": [102], "these": [104, 139], "principles": [105, 132, 140], "stereotypical": [108], "ways": [109], "which": [111], "humans": [112], "perceive": [113], "visual": [114], "stimuli,": [115], "radiology": [117, 151], "learner": [118], "may": [119], "incur": [120], "fewer": [121], "errors": [122], "diagnosis.": [124], "This": [125], "article": [126], "serves": [127], "introduce": [129], "several": [130], "important": [131], "theory,": [135], "identify": [136], "examples": [137], "widely": [142], "recognizable": [143], "fine": [144], "art,": [145], "highlight": [147], "their": [148], "implications": [149], "for": [150], "education.": [152]}, "authors": ["Nicholas A.

Although the Gestalt school fell out of favor due to its descriptive rather than explanatory nature, it permanently changed our understanding of perception. For the radiologist, such fundamental Gestalt concepts as figure-ground relationships and a variety of \"grouping principles\" (the laws of closure, proximity, similarity, common region, continuity, and symmetry) are ubiquitous in daily work, not to mention in art and personal life.By considering the applications of these principles and the stereotypical ways in which humans perceive visual stimuli, a radiology learner may incur fewer errors of diagnosis. This article serves to introduce several important principles of Gestalt theory, identify examples of these principles in widely recognizable fine art, and highlight their implications for radiology education."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2092290973", "relevance_score": 273.096, "publication_year": 1976, "title": "Therapeutic radiology\u2014the modalities and their effects on oral tissues", "cited_by_count": 43, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Modalities", "level": 2, "score": 0.74762875}, {"display_name": "Therapeutic modalities", "level": 2, "score": 0.6908979}, {"display_name": "Radiation therapy", "level": 2, "score": 0.6725439}, {"display_name": "Head and neck", "level": 2, "score": 0.6338238}, {"display_name": "Therapeutic index", "level": 3, "score": 0.5409442}, {"display_name": "Population", "level": 2, "score": 0.48952875}, {"display_name": "Therapeutic approach", "level": 3, "score": 0.47703144}, {"display_name": "Intensive care medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.44363362}, {"display_name": "Therapeutic effect", "level": 2, "score": 0.433195}, {"display_name": "Dental practice", "level": 2, "score": 0.4296161}, {"display_name": "Dental care", "level": 2, "score": 0.42214563}, {"display_name": "Dentistry", "level": 1, "score": 0.3932678}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.3715374}, {"display_name": "Pathology", "level": 1, "score": 0.2891078}, {"display_name": "Surgery", "level": 1, "score": 0.28653234}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Commonly": [0, 99], "applied": [1, 100], "methods": [2, 101], "of": [3, 26, 34, 69, 96, 102, 125, 133, 168, 195], "irradiation": [4, 103], "and": [5, 28, 62, 74, 94, 104, 127, 161, 173, 193], "their": [6, 75, 105, 174], "effects": [7, 77, 106, 176], "on": [8, 78, 107, 177], "the": [9, 24, 35, 48, 70, 79, 87, 92, 108, 123, 134, 147, 169, 178, 186, 191], "oral": [10, 80, 109, 179], "tissues": [11, 81, 110, 180], "are": [12, 44, 111, 143], "discussed.": [13, 112], "In": [14, 113], "recent": [15, 114], "years,": [16, 115], "therapeutic": [17, 72, 116, 171], "radiology": [18, 117], "has": [19, 82, 118, 181], "been": [20, 39, 83, 119, 138, 182], "used": [21, 120], "extensively": [22, 121], "in": [23, 65, 90, 122, 164, 189], "management": [25, 124], "head": [27, 126], "neck": [29, 128], "malignancies.": [30, 129], "An": [31, 130], "increasing": [32, 131], "number": [33, 132], "population": [36, 135], "who": [37, 136], "have": [38, 137], "exposed": [40, 139], "to": [41, 85, 140, 184], "such": [42, 97, 141, 196], "therapy": [43, 58, 142, 157], "being": [45, 144], "seen": [46, 145], "by": [47, 146], "dentist": [49, 148], "for": [50, 149], "dental": [51, 88, 150, 187], "treatment.": [52, 151], "It": [53, 152], "is": [54, 153], "recognized": [55, 154], "that": [56, 155], "radiation": [57, 156], "may": [59, 158], "cause": [60, 159], "temporary": [61, 160], "permanent": [63, 162], "alterations": [64, 163], "tissue": [66, 165], "a": [67, 166], "discussion": [68, 167], "various": [71, 170], "modalities": [73, 172], "side": [76, 175], "presented": [84, 183], "aid": [86, 185], "practitioner": [89, 188], "understanding": [91, 190], "problems": [93, 192], "care": [95, 194], "patients.": [98, 197]}, "authors": ["Ronald Lee Rubin", "H.Chris Doku"], "abstract": "Commonly applied methods of irradiation and their effects on the oral tissues are discussed.

Current trends in radiology residents' studying habits, their use of electronic and printed radiology learning resources, and how much of the funds allotted to them are being used toward printed vs electronic education tools were assessed in this study. Methods A survey study was conducted among radiology residents across the United States from June 13 to July 5, 2011. Program directors listed in the Association of Program Directors in Radiology e-mail list server received an e-mail asking for residents to participate in an online survey. The questionnaire consisted of 12 questions and assessed the type of institution, the levels of training of the respondents, and book funds allocated to residents. It also assessed the residents' study habits, access to portable devices, and use of printed and electronic radiology resources. Results Radiology residents are adopters of new technologies, with 74% owning smart phones and 37% owning tablet devices. Respondents spend nearly an equal amount of time learning radiology from printed textbooks as they do from electronic resources. Eighty-one percent of respondents believe that they would spend more time learning radiology if provided with tablet devices. Conclusions There is considerable use of online and electronic resources and mobile devices among the current generation of radiology residents.

Participants volunteered from the UK Police Force [FE (n = 6, age 33 \u00b1 4 years, body mass 85.3 \u00b1 7.9 kg, [Vdot]O2max 53 \u00b1 5 ml \u00b7 kg\u22121 \u00b7 min\u22121), UE and CC (n = 11, age 34 \u00b1 5 years, body mass 88.5 \u00b1 13.8 kg, [Vdot]O2max 51 \u00b1 5 ml \u00b7 kg\u22121 \u00b7 min\u22121)]. Heart rate reserve (HRR) during FE was greater than UE (74 \u00b1 7 vs. 62 \u00b1 6%HRR, p = 0.01) but lower in CC (39 \u00b1 7%HRR, p < 0.01). Peak core body temperature was greater during FE (39.2 \u00b1 0.3\u00b0C) than UE (38.9 \u00b1 0.4\u00b0C, p < 0.01) and CC (37.5 \u00b1 0.3\u00b0C, p < 0.01), with similar trends in skin temperature. There were no differences in the volume of water consumed (1.13 \u00b1 0.44 l, p = 0.51) or change in body mass (\u22121.68 \u00b1 0.65 kg, p = 0.74) between simulations. The increase in body temperature was a primary physiological limitation to performance. Cooling strategies and revised operating procedures may improve Police Officers\u2019 physical performance while wearing CBRN PPE. Practitioner Summary. In recent years, the likelihood of Police Officers having to respond to a chemical, biological, nuclear or radiological (CBRN) incident wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) has increased. Such apparel is likely to increase physiological strain and impair job performance; understanding these limitations may help improve Officer safety and operational effectiveness.

However, the diagnostic power of MRI is strongly related to the appropriate selection and interpretation of imaging protocols and sequences. The aim of this article is to review state-of-the-art sequences for the clinical routine in head & neck MRI and to describe the evidence for which medical question these sequences and techniques are useful. Method Literature review of state-of-the-art sequences in head & neck MRI. Results and Conclusion Basic sequences (T1w, T2w, T1wC+) and fat suppression techniques (TIRM/STIR, Dixon, Spectral Fat sat) are important tools in the diagnostic workup of inflammation, congenital lesions and tumors including staging. Additional sequences (SSFP (CISS, FIESTA), SPACE, VISTA, 3D-FLAIR) are used for pathologies of the cranial nerves, labyrinth and evaluation of endolymphatic hydrops in Meni\u00e8re's disease. Vessel and perfusion sequences (3D-TOF, TWIST/TRICKS angiography, DCE) are used in vascular contact syndromes, vascular malformations and analysis of microvascular parameters of tissue perfusion. Diffusion-weighted imaging (EPI-DWI, non-EPI-DWI, RESOLVE) is helpful in cholesteatoma imaging, estimation of malignancy, and evaluation of treatment response and posttreatment recurrence in head & neck cancer. Understanding of MRI sequences and close collaboration with referring physicians improves the diagnostic confidence of MRI in the daily routine and drives further research in this fascinating image modality.

Even the normal anatomy of this complex site is subject to great variation and the aspiring radiologist should, therefore, have a good knowledge of the possible normal variations. A flexible approach must be used rather than a limitation to one or two ritual projections. The use of contrast media, wherever it might be useful, is advocated so that the maximum amount of information may be obtained from each examination. Finally, emphasis is laid on the fallibility of radiology when used in isolation and its use to complement other investigative procedures, such as endoscopy, is encouraged."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2100648393", "relevance_score": 239.71841, "publication_year": 2014, "title": "Clinical, radiological and therapeutic features of keratocystic odontogenic tumours: a study over a decade", "cited_by_count": 43, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Keratocyst", "level": 3, "score": 0.9922782}, {"display_name": "Enucleation", "level": 2, "score": 0.871728}, {"display_name": "Keratocystic Odontogenic Tumor", "level": 3, "score": 0.7926604}, {"display_name": "Odontogenic", "level": 2, "score": 0.6040028}, {"display_name": "Odontogenic cyst", "level": 3, "score": 0.52994025}, {"display_name": "Dentistry", "level": 1, "score": 0.5001776}, {"display_name": "Ostectomy", "level": 2, "score": 0.49899197}, {"display_name": "Molar", "level": 2, "score": 0.4918399}, {"display_name": "Lesion", "level": 2, "score": 0.46286947}, {"display_name": "Maxilla", "level": 2, "score": 0.43584502}, {"display_name": "Pathology", "level": 1, "score": 0.2889042}, {"display_name": "Surgery", "level": 1, "score": 0.22946405}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Factors": [0], "associated": [1, 38, 64, 178], "with": [2, 39, 65, 103, 146, 153, 170, 176, 179, 187, 191], "the": [3, 23, 59, 74, 83, 106, 131, 144, 166, 201], "potential": [4], "for": [5, 203, 207], "recurrence": [6, 124, 139, 164], "of": [7, 25, 29, 50, 73, 89, 108, 130, 168, 198, 210], "keratocystic": [8], "odontogenic": [9, 214], "tumours": [10], "(KCOT)": [11], "still": [12], "remain": [13], "to": [14, 33, 56, 86], "be": [15], "clearly": [16], "determined": [17], "and": [18, 41, 82, 125, 165], "no": [19], "consensus": [20], "exists": [21], "concerning": [22], "management": [24], "KCOT.": [26, 211], "The": [27, 71, 94, 138], "purpose": [28], "this": [30], "study": [31], "was": [32, 48, 92, 112, 121, 141], "evaluate": [34], "different": [35], "clinical": [36], "factors": [37], "KCOT": [40], "its": [42], "treatment": [43, 95], "methods.": [44], "A": [45], "retrospective": [46], "review": [47], "performed": [49], "55": [51, 60], "cases": [52, 116, 152, 174, 186], "treated": [53, 175], "from": [54], "2001": [55], "2010.": [57], "Of": [58], "cases,": [61, 128], "27%": [62], "were": [63, 77], "an": [66], "impacted": [67], "or": [68, 100, 104, 133, 135], "semi-impacted": [69], "tooth.": [70], "majority": [72], "lesions": [75], "(82%)": [76], "located": [78], "in": [79, 114, 143, 151, 173], "tooth-bearing": [80], "areas,": [81], "overall": [84], "mandibular": [85], "maxilla": [87], "ratio": [88], "tumour": [90], "occurrence": [91], "5:1.": [93], "options": [96], "included": [97], "enucleation,": [98], "marsupialisation,": [99], "peripheral": [101, 208], "ostectomy,": [102], "without": [105], "use": [107], "Carnoy\u00b4s": [109], "solution.": [110, 222], "Recurrence": [111], "found": [113], "14": [115], "(25%).": [117], "No": [118], "significant": [119, 161], "association": [120], "seen": [122], "between": [123, 163], "age,": [126], "symptomatic": [127], "location": [129], "lesion,": [132], "unilocular": [134], "multilocular": [136], "appearance.": [137], "rate": [140], "higher": [142, 171, 196], "group": [145], "tooth": [147, 180], "involvement,": [148], "more": [149], "marked": [150], "third": [154], "molar": [155], "involvement.": [156], "Statistical": [157], "analysis": [158], "showed": [159, 194], "a": [160, 188, 195, 204], "relation": [162, 190], "type": [167], "treatment,": [169], "rates": [172], "enucleation": [177], "extraction.": [181], "In": [182], "our": [183], "series,": [184], "those": [185], "closer": [189], "dental": [192], "tissues": [193], "risk": [197], "recurrence,": [199], "suggesting": [200], "need": [202], "distinct": [205], "classification": [206], "variants": [209], "Key": [212], "words:Keratocystic": [213], "tumour,": [215], "Odontogenic": [216, 218], "keratocyst,": [217], "cysts,": [219], "Keratocyst,": [220], "Carnoy's": [221]}, "authors": ["Roc\u00edo S\u00e1nchez-Burgos", "J.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate different clinical factors associated with KCOT and its treatment methods. A retrospective review was performed of 55 cases treated from 2001 to 2010. Of the 55 cases, 27% were associated with an impacted or semi-impacted tooth. The majority of the lesions (82%) were located in tooth-bearing areas, and the overall mandibular to maxilla ratio of tumour occurrence was 5:1. The treatment options included enucleation, marsupialisation, or peripheral ostectomy, with or without the use of Carnoy\u00b4s solution. Recurrence was found in 14 cases (25%). No significant association was seen between recurrence and age, symptomatic cases, location of the lesion, or unilocular or multilocular appearance. The recurrence rate was higher in the group with tooth involvement, more marked in cases with third molar involvement. Statistical analysis showed a significant relation between recurrence and the type of treatment, with higher rates in cases treated with enucleation associated with tooth extraction. In our series, those cases with a closer relation with dental tissues showed a higher risk of recurrence, suggesting the need for a distinct classification for peripheral variants of KCOT.

We mapped categories of services annually to then-current Current Procedural Terminology codes from 1994 to 2012 and identified national Medicare Part B beneficiary paid claims frequency using Physician Supplier Procedure Summary Master Files. Trends were studied for APPs, radiologists, and all providers nationally for 7 categories of service: paracentesis, thoracentesis, fine-needle aspiration (FNA), superficial lymph node biopsy, abdominal biopsy, thoracic biopsy, and abdominal drainage.Of 1,352 nonvascular invasive procedures performed by APPs at our facilities over a 1-year period through August 2013, a total of 1,161 (85.9%) fell into the 7 defined categories. Between 1994 and 2012, national Medicare claims by APPs increased dramatically for all of these categories: paracentesis from 0 to 17,967; thoracentesis from 119 to 4,141 (+3,379%); FNA from 0 to 3,921; superficial lymph node biopsy from 0 to 251; abdominal biopsy from 1 to 1,819 (+1,818%); thoracic biopsy from 0 to 552; and abdominal drainage from 37 to 410 (+1,008%). Overall, volumes increased for both radiologists and all providers, with the total fraction of national services performed by APPs increasing from 0% to 10.7% for paracentesis, 0.1% to 5.7% for thoracentesis, 0% to 2.1% for FNA, 0% to 1.4% for superficial lymph node biopsy, 0% to 1.7% for abdominal biopsy, 0% to 1.0% for thoracic biopsy, and 0.1% to 1.2% for abdominal drainage.Although APPs perform a relatively small portion of commonly performed nonvascular invasive radiology procedures nationally, paid Medicare claims for those services have increased dramatically over nearly 2 decades, and at a faster pace than that for all providers as a whole. Given the multiple hurdles involved in obtaining Medicare reimbursement, that growth indicates increasing acceptance of APPs as procedure service providers at the institutional credentialing, state licensure, and payer policy levels."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W1976058740", "relevance_score": 206.39847, "publication_year": 2014, "title": "Assessment of coincidence and defect sizes in Bankart and Hill\u2013Sachs lesions after anterior shoulder dislocation: a radiological study", "cited_by_count": 43, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Bankart lesion", "level": 3, "score": 0.9068861}, {"display_name": "Lesion", "level": 2, "score": 0.7219751}, {"display_name": "Bankart repair", "level": 3, "score": 0.5459969}, {"display_name": "Confidence interval", "level": 2, "score": 0.545951}, {"display_name": "Odds ratio", "level": 2, "score": 0.5160555}, {"display_name": "Anterior shoulder dislocation", "level": 3, "score": 0.45393005}, {"display_name": "Surgery", "level": 1, "score": 0.44580662}, {"display_name": "Anterior shoulder", "level": 2, "score": 0.4202164}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.37817603}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Objective:": [0], "Bankart": [1, 29, 79, 145, 166, 217, 228, 236, 266], "and": [2, 30, 41, 50, 61, 147, 237, 267, 274], "Hill\u2013Sachs": [3, 31, 88, 152, 173, 208, 238, 268], "lesions": [4, 32, 80, 89, 167, 174, 269], "are": [5], "often": [6, 125, 170], "associated": [7, 202], "with": [8, 33, 56, 127, 171], "anterior": [9, 58, 271], "shoulder": [10, 59, 272], "dislocation.": [11], "The": [12, 21, 99, 204], "MRI": [13, 34, 254], "technique": [14], "is": [15, 189, 193, 245], "sensitive": [16], "in": [17, 39, 70, 223, 241, 255, 270], "diagnosing": [18], "both": [19], "injuries.": [20], "aim": [22], "of": [23, 44, 63, 101, 150, 206, 213, 227, 235, 252, 260, 265], "this": [24], "study": [25, 244], "was": [26, 103, 154], "to": [27, 35, 198, 248], "investigate": [28], "determine": [36], "the": [37, 71, 148, 191, 201, 211, 225, 233, 246, 250, 278], "correlation": [38, 142, 264], "occurrence": [40], "defect": [42, 279], "sizes": [43], "these": [45, 64], "lesions.": [46, 87, 218, 239], "Methods:": [47], "Between": [48], "2006": [49], "2013,": [51], "446": [52], "patients": [53, 65, 74], "were": [54, 66, 75, 81, 90], "diagnosed": [55], "an": [57, 275], "dislocation": [60], "105": [62], "eligible": [67], "for": [68], "inclusion": [69], "study.": [72], "All": [73], "examined": [76], "using": [77, 93], "MRI.": [78], "classified": [82], "as": [83, 230, 232], "cartilaginous": [84, 214], "or": [85, 215], "bony": [86, 216], "graded": [91], "I\u2013III": [92], "a": [94, 128, 144, 151, 207, 221, 256, 262], "modified": [95], "Calandra": [96], "classification.": [97], "Results:": [98], "co-occurrence": [100, 212, 234], "injuries": [102], "high": [104], "[odds": [105], "ratio": [106], "(OR)": [107], "=": [108, 114, 132, 136, 139, 157, 161, 176, 180, 183], "11.47;": [109], "95%": [110, 134, 159, 178], "confidence": [111], "interval": [112], "(CI)": [113], "3.60\u201336.52;": [115], "p": [116, 138, 163, 182], "<": [117, 164], "0.001].": [118], "Patients": [119], "older": [120], "than": [121], "29": [122], "years": [123], "more": [124, 169, 196], "presented": [126], "bilateral": [129], "injury": [130], "(OR": [131, 175], "16.29;": [133], "CI": [135, 160, 179], "2.71\u201397.73;": [137], "0.002).": [140], "A": [141], "between": [143, 277], "lesion": [146, 153, 188, 209, 229], "grade": [149], "found": [155], "(\u03c1": [156], "0.34;": [158], "0.16\u20130.49;": [162], "0.001).": [165], "co-occurred": [168], "large": [172, 258], "1.24;": [177], "1.02\u20131.52;": [181], "0.033).": [184], "Conclusion:": [185], "If": [186], "either": [187], "diagnosed,": [190], "patient": [192], "11": [194], "times": [195], "likely": [197], "have": [199], "suffered": [200], "injury.": [203], "size": [205], "determines": [210], "Age": [219], "plays": [220], "role": [222], "determining": [224], "type": [226], "well": [231], "Advances": [240], "knowledge:": [242], "This": [243], "first": [247], "demonstrate": [249], "use": [251], "high-quality": [253], "reasonably": [257], "sample": [259], "patients,": [261], "positive": [263], "dislocations": [273], "association": [276], "sizes.": [280]}, "authors": ["Klemens Horst", "R Von Harten", "Clemens Weber", "Hagen Andruszkow", "Roman Pfeifer", "Thomas Dienstknecht", "Hans-Christian Pape"], "abstract": "Objective: Bankart and Hill\u2013Sachs lesions are often associated with anterior shoulder dislocation. The MRI technique is sensitive in diagnosing both injuries. The aim of this study was to investigate Bankart and Hill\u2013Sachs lesions with MRI to determine the correlation in occurrence and defect sizes of these lesions. Methods: Between 2006 and 2013, 446 patients were diagnosed with an anterior shoulder dislocation and 105 of these patients were eligible for inclusion in the study. All patients were examined using MRI. Bankart lesions were classified as cartilaginous or bony lesions. Hill\u2013Sachs lesions were graded I\u2013III using a modified Calandra classification. Results: The co-occurrence of injuries was high [odds ratio (OR) = 11.47; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.60\u201336.52; p < 0.001]. Patients older than 29 years more often presented with a bilateral injury (OR = 16.29; 95% CI = 2.71\u201397.73; p = 0.002). A correlation between a Bankart lesion and the grade of a Hill\u2013Sachs lesion was found (\u03c1 = 0.34; 95% CI = 0.16\u20130.49; p < 0.001). Bankart lesions co-occurred more often with large Hill\u2013Sachs lesions (OR = 1.24; 95% CI = 1.02\u20131.52; p = 0.033). Conclusion: If either lesion is diagnosed, the patient is 11 times more likely to have suffered the associated injury. The size of a Hill\u2013Sachs lesion determines the co-occurrence of cartilaginous or bony Bankart lesions. Age plays a role in determining the type of Bankart lesion as well as the co-occurrence of Bankart and Hill\u2013Sachs lesions. Advances in knowledge: This study is the first to demonstrate the use of high-quality MRI in a reasonably large sample of patients, a positive correlation of Bankart and Hill\u2013Sachs lesions in anterior shoulder dislocations and an association between the defect sizes."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2037277067", "relevance_score": 199.9298, "publication_year": 2002, "title": "CONTRAST

Especially in the course of conservative treatment, the radiation dose might increase during the years. With the development of ultrasound echo enhancing agents we assessed their diagnostic efficacy for evaluation of vesicoureteral reflux to replace voiding cystourethrography with radiation-free ultrasound. Materials and Methods: A total of 104 children with a mean age of 5.4 years were examined using echo enhancing ultrasound after informed consent was obtained. For control purposes, all children underwent standard voiding cystourethrography as well. The diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux was positive when microbubbles appeared in the ureter or renal pelvis. The sonographic findings were correlated with those obtained by standard voiding cystourethrography. Results: Of the 208 ureter and renal units investigated vesicoureteral reflux was detected in 76 (37%) by both technologies. Diagnosis was made sonographically in 5 units and by voiding cystourethrography in 3. All reflux grades (I to V) could be identified. The specificity and sensitivity of the contrast reflux ultrasound were significantly high. The long contrast time of up to 30 minutes combined with the high contrast effect resulted in convincing images with high levels of diagnostic confidence. Conclusions: Our results clearly demonstrate that the diagnostic accuracy of vesicoureteral reflux by contrast enhanced ultrasound is statistically significant compared to standard radiological voiding cystourethrography. Therefore, this methodology represents an exceptional approach to reduce the number of children being exposed to ionizing radiation especially during conservative followup.

Hybrid imaging instrumentation, combining 2 or more new or existing technologies, each with its own separate history of clinical evolution, such as PET and CT, may be especially challenging. CT and PET provide complementary anatomic information and molecular information, respectively, with PET giving specificity to anatomic findings and CT offering precise localization of metabolic activity. Historically, the acquisition and interpretation of the 2 image sets have been performed separately and very often at different times and locales. Recently, integrated PET/CT systems have become available; these systems provide PET and CT images that are acquired nearly simultaneously and are capable of producing superimposed, coregistered images, greatly facilitating interpretation. As the implementation of this integrated technology has become more widespread in the setting of oncologic imaging, questions and concerns regarding equipment specifications, image acquisition protocols, supervision, interpretation, professional qualifications, and safety have arisen.

To prevent medical errors from occurring, there is a need for a readily available and easy-to-implement system for detecting, classifying, and managing mistakes. The wide spectrum of interrelated contributing factors makes the classification of errors difficult. Contributors to and causes of radiologic errors can be classified under latent and active failures. Latent failures include technical and system-related failures, with a radiology-specific subgroup of communication failures that includes documentation, inaccurate or incomplete information, and communication loop failures. Active failures may be ascribed to human failures (more specifically failure of execution of a task, inadequate planning, or behavior-related failures), patient-based failures, and external failures. Classification of an error should also include the impact of the error on the patient, staff, other customers, and radiology practice. Further considerations should include nonmedical impact of the error, including legal, social, and economic effects on both the patient and the system. Rather than focusing the investigation on blaming individuals for active failures, the primary effort should be to discover latent system failures that can be remedied at a departmental level. Such an error classification system will decrease the likelihood of future errors and diminish their adverse impact. \u00a9 RSNA, 2010"}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W1517288426", "relevance_score": 288.77844, "publication_year": 2003, "title": "The diagnosis and management of pre-invasive breast disease: Radiological diagnosis", "cited_by_count": 42, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Mammography", "level": 4, "score": 0.7241932}, {"display_name": "Microcalcification", "level": 5, "score": 0.71185285}, {"display_name": "Radiological weapon", "level": 2, "score": 0.63814694}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.62693465}, {"display_name": "Asymptomatic", "level": 2, "score": 0.5791524}, {"display_name": "Ductal carcinoma", "level": 4, "score": 0.5253852}, {"display_name": "Breast cancer", "level": 3, "score": 0.5105194}, {"display_name": "Surgical oncology", "level": 2, "score": 0.5017469}, {"display_name": "Disease", "level": 2, "score": 0.49178508}, {"display_name": "Calcification", "level": 2, "score": 0.47256723}, {"display_name": "Biopsy", "level": 2, "score": 0.46587512}, {"display_name": "Pathology", "level": 1, "score": 0.35402817}, {"display_name": "Oncology", "level": 1, "score": 0.26371104}, {"display_name": "Internal medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.20948073}, {"display_name": "Cancer", "level": 2, "score": 0.20395374}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Pre-invasive": [0], "disease": [1, 31], "is": [2, 18], "most": [3], "frequently": [4], "diagnosed": [5], "in": [6, 21, 38, 51], "asymptomatic": [7], "women": [8], "following": [9], "detection": [10], "of": [11, 29, 47, 58, 64, 67], "microcalcification": [12], "at": [13, 53], "mammography.": [14], "The": [15, 45], "vast": [16], "majority": [17], "ductal": [19, 49], "carcinoma": [20, 50], "situ.": [22], "This": [23], "article": [24], "summarizes": [25], "the": [26, 56], "radiological": [27], "features": [28, 35], "pre-invasive": [30], "and": [32, 42, 62], "indicates": [33], "which": [34], "are": [36, 69], "helpful": [37], "differentiating": [39], "between": [40], "benign": [41], "malignant": [43], "conditions.": [44], "value": [46], "finding": [48], "situ": [52], "screening,": [54], "predicting": [55], "presence": [57], "an": [59], "invasive": [60], "focus": [61], "methods": [63], "percutaneous": [65], "biopsy": [66], "calcification": [68], "also": [70], "addressed.": [71]}, "authors": ["Andy Evans"], "abstract": "Pre-invasive disease is most frequently diagnosed in asymptomatic women following detection of microcalcification at mammography.

Twenty-six patients had diffuse scleroderma (dSSc) and 15 limited scleroderma (lSSc). Radiological examination of the hands was performed and the films were read by two independent rheumatologists blinded to the diagnosis using a classification system of four predefined radiological patterns (normal/minimal changes, articular degenerative, articular inflammatory and periarticular pattern). Correlations between radiological pattern, clinical and serological features were assessed.The skeletal and articular involvement of the hand was frequent in SSc, being clinically evident in 30/41 (73%) and radiologically in 33/41 (80%) of patients. The periarticular pattern (defined as the occurrence of bone resorption of ungueal tufts, soft tissue calcifications and/or flexion deformities) was the most frequent pattern detected (14/41, 34.1%) and finger flexion contractures and bone resorptions were significantly associated with interstitial lung disease, reduced FVC, oesophagus involvement and prostacycline therapy. Calcinosis (29.2%) was found to be associated with erosions, suggesting a pathogenic link. An inflammatory pattern was also radiologically frequent (8/41, 19.5%), but erosions, with the exception of those localized at distal interphalangeal joints, were demonstrated mainly in patients with clinical picture of rheumatoid arthritis overlapped with SSc. We found no significant differences in terms of radiographic findings between lSSc and dSSc with the exception of calcinosis, which was more frequent in patients with lSSc.This cross-sectional study confirms that the skeletal and articular involvement of the hand is frequent in SSc."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2126976038", "relevance_score": 260.7044, "publication_year": 2009, "title": "Impact of Radiologic Intervention on Mortality in Necrotizing Pancreatitis", "cited_by_count": 42, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Surgery", "level": 1, "score": 0.6254841}, {"display_name": "Percutaneous", "level": 2, "score": 0.56537914}, {"display_name": "Necrosis", "level": 2, "score": 0.51915944}, {"display_name": "Pancreatitis", "level": 2, "score": 0.49952984}, {"display_name": "Retrospective cohort study", "level": 2, "score": 0.49419883}, {"display_name": "Intensive care", "level": 2, "score": 0.41169629}, {"display_name": "Internal medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.29476562}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"<h3>Background</h3>": [0], "Our": [1], "group": [2], "previously": [3], "reported": [4], "that": [5, 25], "organ": [6, 95, 113, 137, 198, 210, 227], "failure": [7, 114, 138], "and": [8, 21, 43, 76, 94, 175, 181, 207], "mortality": [9, 52, 106, 221], "in": [10, 53, 153, 162, 171, 182], "necrotizing": [11], "pancreatitis": [12, 73], "(NP)": [13], "are": [14], "not": [15, 131, 218], "different": [16], "between": [17, 74], "patients": [18, 69, 101, 110, 122, 154, 192, 225], "with": [19, 102, 121, 123, 127, 164, 173, 184, 194, 205, 226], "infected": [20, 128], "sterile": [22, 124], "necrosis.": [23], "Since": [24], "report,": [26], "management": [27], "of": [28, 49, 66, 78, 136, 159, 168, 178, 188, 203, 215, 222], "this": [29], "disease": [30], "has": [31], "evolved": [32], "to": [33, 40, 116], "include": [34], "image-guided": [35], "percutaneous": [36], "catheter": [37], "drainage": [38], "(PCD)": [39], "improve": [41, 219], "morbidity": [42], "mortality.": [44, 151], "We": [45], "evaluated": [46], "the": [47, 99, 117, 220], "effect": [48], "PCD": [50, 165, 174, 195, 206, 216], "on": [51, 86], "NP.": [54], "<h3>Design</h3>": [55], "Retrospective": [56], "analysis.": [57], "<h3>Setting</h3>": [58], "Tertiary": [59], "care": [60], "referral": [61], "center.": [62], "<h3>Patients</h3>": [63], "A": [64], "total": [65], "689": [67], "consecutive": [68], "treated": [70, 155, 193], "for": [71, 142], "acute": [72], "2001": [75], "2005,": [77], "whom": [79], "64": [80, 100], "(9.3%)": [81], "had": [82, 112, 148, 197, 209], "pancreatic": [83], "necrosis": [84, 129], "documented": [85, 103], "contrast-enhanced": [87], "computed": [88], "tomography.": [89], "<h3>Main": [90], "Outcome": [91], "Measures</h3>": [92], "Mortality": [93, 152], "failure.": [96, 211, 228], "<h3>Results</h3>": [97], "In": [98], "NP,": [104], "overall": [105], "was": [107, 157], "16%.": [108], "Thirty-six": [109], "(56%)": [111], "according": [115], "Atlanta": [118], "classification.": [119], "Compared": [120], "necrosis,": [125], "those": [126, 163, 172, 183, 204], "did": [130, 217], "have": [132], "an": [133, 149], "increased": [134, 140, 150], "prevalence": [135], "or": [139, 145], "need": [141], "intubation,": [143], "pressors,": [144], "dialysis": [146], "but": [147], "conservatively": [156], "1": [158, 187], "29": [160], "(3%);": [161], "alone,": [166, 186], "6": [167], "11": [169], "(55%);": [170], "surgery,": [176], "2": [177], "17": [179], "(12%);": [180], "surgery": [185, 208], "7": [189], "(14%).": [190], "All": [191], "alone": [196], "failure,": [199], "whereas": [200], "10": [201], "(59%)": [202], "<h3>Conclusion</h3>": [212], "The": [213], "use": [214], "NP": [223], "among": [224]}, "authors": ["Flavio G.

The purposes of the meeting was to share quality improvement experiences, consider a strategy for promoting quality improvement initiatives across the radiology profession, and initiate quality benchmarking efforts. Representatives from private practice, academia, national quality programs, and international societies were in attendance. Four main themes were presented: the sharing of leading quality activities in radiology, the future of pay-for-performance systems, programs and future initiatives of professional radiology societies, and health services research guidelines for developing outcome metrics. This white paper summarizes information presented in each of these thematic areas and concludes with the group's plans for future activities. Among these is a formal educational program for all radiologists interested in implementing a quality improvement program within their practice, to be hosted by the ACR."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2115570566", "relevance_score": 256.8069, "publication_year": 2013, "title": "An enhanced CRFs-based system for information extraction from radiology reports", "cited_by_count": 42, "concepts": [{"display_name": "CRFS", "level": 3, "score": 0.98413193}, {"display_name": "Conditional random field", "level": 2, "score": 0.9489641}, {"display_name": "Artificial intelligence", "level": 1, "score": 0.6255328}, {"display_name": "Annotation", "level": 2, "score": 0.5538383}, {"display_name": "Named-entity recognition", "level": 3, "score": 0.53546304}, {"display_name": "Information extraction", "level": 2, "score": 0.53167766}, {"display_name": "Sentence", "level": 2, "score": 0.52368915}, {"display_name": "Natural language processing", "level": 1, "score": 0.5159986}, {"display_name": "Domain (mathematical analysis)", "level": 2, "score": 0.49543488}, {"display_name": "Feature (linguistics)", "level": 2, "score": 0.4710614}, {"display_name": "Task (project management)", "level": 2, "score": 0.44106588}, {"display_name": "Pattern recognition (psychology)", "level": 2, "score": 0.3616584}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"We": [0, 95, 138], "discuss": [1], "the": [2, 43, 71, 91, 99, 113, 120, 136, 149], "problem": [3], "of": [4, 19, 40, 101, 107, 116, 122, 135, 144], "performing": [5], "information": [6], "extraction": [7], "from": [8], "free-text": [9], "radiology": [10, 57], "reports": [11, 146], "via": [12, 70], "supervised": [13], "learning.": [14], "In": [15, 46], "this": [16, 47], "task,": [17], "segments": [18], "text": [20], "(not": [21], "necessarily": [22], "coinciding": [23], "with": [24, 36], "entire": [25], "sentences,": [26], "and": [27, 80, 90], "possibly": [28], "crossing": [29], "sentence": [30], "boundaries)": [31], "need": [32], "to": [33, 54, 110, 129, 154], "be": [34, 127], "annotated": [35], "tags": [37], "representing": [38], "concepts": [39], "interest": [41], "in": [42, 112, 118, 132, 147, 161], "radiological": [44], "domain.": [45], "paper": [48], "we": [49], "present": [50, 139], "two": [51, 67, 162], "novel": [52, 105], "approaches": [53], "IE": [55], "for": [56], "reports:": [58], "(i)": [59], "a": [60, 82, 104, 123, 142, 156], "cascaded,": [61], "two-stage": [62, 93], "method": [63, 85], "based": [64], "on": [65, 98, 141], "pipelining": [66], "taggers": [68], "generated": [69], "well": [72], "known": [73], "linear-chain": [74], "conditional": [75], "random": [76], "fields": [77], "(LC-CRFs)": [78], "learner": [79], "(ii)": [81], "confidence-weighted": [83], "ensemble": [84, 151], "that": [86], "combines": [87], "standard": [88], "LC-CRFs": [89], "proposed": [92, 150], "method.": [94], "also": [96], "report": [97], "use": [100], "\u201cpositional": [102], "features\u201d,": [103], "type": [106], "feature": [108], "intended": [109], "aid": [111], "automatic": [114], "annotation": [115], "texts": [117], "which": [119, 148], "instances": [121], "given": [124], "concept": [125], "may": [126], "hypothesized": [128], "systematically": [130], "occur": [131], "specific": [133], "areas": [134], "text.": [137], "experiments": [140], "dataset": [143], "mammography": [145], "is": [152], "shown": [153], "outperform": [155], "traditional,": [157], "single-stage": [158], "CRFs": [159], "system": [160], "different,": [163], "applicatively": [164], "interesting": [165], "scenarios.": [166]}, "authors": ["Andrea Esuli", "Diego Marcheggiani", "Fabrizio Sebastiani"], "abstract": "We discuss the problem of performing information extraction from free-text radiology reports via supervised learning.

The SC features of TMJ on magnetic resonance (MR) images were summarized on proton density-weighted (PD) and T2-weighted images.Synovial chondromatosis of TMJ occurred more often in women and on the right. Symptoms included preauricular pain, swelling, limitation of mouth opening, crepitations, and deviation on opening. The detection rate of calcified loose bodies was 30% on conventional radiographs and 53.3% on computerized tomography. Multiple small ring-like or tubular signals could be seen on PD and T2-weighted MR images. SC mainly affected the superior joint space; it could involve the inferior space when a perforated or deformed disc was present. SC could extend into intracranial fossa, infratemporal fossa, and lateral pytergoid muscle.The characteristic ring-like signals could be found on MR images of the patients with SC of TMJ.

"Syed Jafri"], "abstract": "A wide range of clinically important anatomic variants and pathologic conditions may affect the renal vasculature, and radiologists have a pivotal role in the diagnosis and management of these processes. Because many of these entities may not be suspected clinically, renal artery and vein assessment is an essential application of all imaging modalities. An understanding of the normal vascular anatomy is essential for recognizing clinically important anatomic variants. An understanding of the protocols used to optimize imaging modalities also is necessary. Renal artery stenosis is the most common cause of secondary hypertension and is diagnosed by using both direct ultrasonographic (US) findings at the site of stenosis and indirect US findings distal to the stenosis. Fibromuscular dysplasia, while not as common as atherosclerosis, remains an important cause of renal artery hypertension, especially among young female individuals. Fibromuscular dysplasia also predisposes individuals to renal artery aneurysms and dissection. Although most renal artery dissections are extensions of aortic dissections, on rare occasion they occur in isolation. Renal artery aneurysms often are not suspected clinically before imaging, but they can lead to catastrophic outcomes if they are overlooked. Unlike true aneurysms, pseudoaneurysms are typically iatrogenic or posttraumatic. However, multiple small pseudoaneurysms may be seen with underlying vasculitis. Arteriovenous fistulas also are commonly iatrogenic, whereas arteriovenous malformations are developmental (ie, congenital). Both of these conditions involve a prominent feeding artery and draining vein; however, arteriovenous malformations contain a nidus of tangled vessels. Nutcracker syndrome should be suspected when there is distention of the left renal vein with abrupt narrowing as it passes posterior to the superior mesenteric artery. Filling defects in a renal vein can be due to a bland or tumor thrombus. A tumor thrombus is most commonly an extension of renal cell carcinoma. When an enhancing mass is located predominantly within a renal vein, leiomyosarcoma of the renal vein should be suspected. \u00a9RSNA, 2017"}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2984220309", "relevance_score": 245.6035, "publication_year": 2021, "title": "Attitudes toward artificial intelligence in radiology with learner needs assessment within radiology residency programmes: a national multi-programme survey", "cited_by_count": 42, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.69142675}, {"display_name": "Curriculum", "level": 2, "score": 0.67350924}, {"display_name": "Medical education", "level": 1, "score": 0.48267177}, {"display_name": "Artificial intelligence", "level": 1, "score": 0.3200432}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"INTRODUCTION": [0], "We": [1], "aimed": [2, 55], "to": [3, 36, 56, 122, 143, 153, 222, 240], "assess": [4], "the": [5, 98], "attitudes": [6], "and": [7, 13, 20, 38, 54, 68, 111, 117, 149, 174, 185, 190, 212, 235], "learner": [8], "needs": [9], "of": [10, 65, 70, 85, 139], "radiology": [11, 44, 108, 113, 125, 231], "residents": [12, 37], "faculty": [14, 39, 95], "radiologists": [15, 40], "regarding": [16], "artificial": [17], "intelligence": [18], "(AI)": [19], "machine": [21], "learning": [22], "(ML)": [23], "in": [24, 41, 47, 74, 124, 136, 156, 218, 248], "radiology.": [25], "METHODS": [26], "A": [27, 83, 227], "web-based": [28], "questionnaire,": [29], "designed": [30], "using": [31], "SurveyMonkey,": [32], "was": [33, 80, 179], "sent": [34], "out": [35], "all": [42], "three": [43], "residency": [45, 76, 199, 249], "programmes": [46], "Singapore.": [48], "The": [49, 100], "questionnaire": [50], "comprised": [51], "four": [52], "sections": [53], "evaluate": [57], "respondents\u2019": [58], "current": [59], "experience,": [60], "attempts": [61], "at": [62], "self-learning,": [63], "perceptions": [64], "career": [66], "prospects": [67], "expectations": [69], "an": [71, 157, 245], "AI/ML": [72, 104, 147, 158, 167, 205, 219, 236, 246], "curriculum": [73, 247], "their": [75, 137, 146, 198], "programme.": [77], "Respondents\u2019": [78], "anonymity": [79], "ensured.": [81], "RESULTS": [82], "total": [84], "125": [86], "respondents": [87, 214], "(86": [88], "male,": [89], "39": [90], "female;": [91], "70": [92], "residents,": [93], "55": [94], "radiologists)": [96], "completed": [97], "questionnaire.": [99], "majority": [101, 163], "agreed": [102], "that": [103, 166, 177, 197], "will": [105], "drastically": [106], "change": [107], "practice": [109], "(88.8%)": [110], "makes": [112], "more": [114, 216], "exciting": [115], "(76.0%),": [116], "most": [118, 175], "would": [119], "still": [120], "choose": [121], "specialise": [123], "if": [126], "given": [127], "a": [128, 241], "choice": [129], "(80.0%).": [130], "64.8%": [131], "viewed": [132], "themselves": [133], "as": [134, 180, 182], "novices": [135], "understanding": [138], "AI/ML,": [140], "76.0%": [141], "planned": [142], "further": [144], "advance": [145], "knowledge": [148, 168], "67.2%": [150], "were": [151, 215], "keen": [152], "get": [154], "involved": [155, 217], "research": [159], "project.": [160], "An": [161], "overwhelming": [162], "(84.8%)": [164], "believed": [165], "should": [169], "be": [170], "taught": [171], "during": [172], "residency,": [173], "opined": [176], "this": [178], "important": [181], "imaging": [183], "physics": [184], "clinical": [186], "skills/knowledge": [187], "curricula": [188], "(80.0%": [189], "72.8%,": [191], "respectively).": [192], "More": [193], "than": [194], "half": [195], "thought": [196], "programme": [200], "had": [201], "not": [202], "adequately": [203], "implemented": [204], "teaching": [206], "(59.2%).": [207], "In": [208], "subgroup": [209], "analyses,": [210], "male": [211], "tech-savvy": [213], "activities,": [220], "leading": [221], "better": [223], "technical": [224], "understanding.": [225], "CONCLUSION": [226], "growing": [228], "optimism": [229], "towards": [230], "undergoing": [232], "technological": [233], "transformation": [234], "implementation": [237], "has": [238], "led": [239], "strong": [242], "demand": [243], "for": [244], "education.": [250]}, "authors": ["Ooi Skg", "Andrew Makmur", "Soon Ayq", "Stephanie Fook\u2010Chong", "Charlene Liew", "Sia Sy", "Ting Yh", "Lim Cy"], "abstract": "INTRODUCTION We aimed to assess the attitudes and learner needs of radiology residents and faculty radiologists regarding artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in radiology. METHODS A web-based questionnaire, designed using SurveyMonkey, was sent out to residents and faculty radiologists in all three radiology residency programmes in Singapore. The questionnaire comprised four sections and aimed to evaluate respondents\u2019 current experience, attempts at self-learning, perceptions of career prospects and expectations of an AI/ML curriculum in their residency programme. Respondents\u2019 anonymity was ensured. RESULTS A total of 125 respondents (86 male, 39 female; 70 residents, 55 faculty radiologists) completed the questionnaire. The majority agreed that AI/ML will drastically change radiology practice (88.8%) and makes radiology more exciting (76.0%), and most would still choose to specialise in radiology if given a choice (80.0%). 64.8% viewed themselves as novices in their understanding of AI/ML, 76.0% planned to further advance their AI/ML knowledge and 67.2% were keen to get involved in an AI/ML research project. An overwhelming majority (84.8%) believed that AI/ML knowledge should be taught during residency, and most opined that this was as important as imaging physics and clinical skills/knowledge curricula (80.0% and 72.8%, respectively). More than half thought that their residency programme had not adequately implemented AI/ML teaching (59.2%). In subgroup analyses, male and tech-savvy respondents were more involved in AI/ML activities, leading to better technical understanding. CONCLUSION A growing optimism towards radiology undergoing technological transformation and AI/ML implementation has led to a strong demand for an AI/ML curriculum in residency education."}, {"id":

The objective of our study was to assess patterns of use of radiology services for inpatients at our institution between 1993 and 2002. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We retrospectively reviewed the administrative data about adult inpatients for fiscal years 1993-2002 in a 721-bed tertiary care institution. Examinations were coded according to imaging technique: conventional (plain films and fluoroscopy), sonography, nuclear medicine, CT, or MRI. We assessed workload trends using relative value units (RVUs). Linear regression analysis was used to assess the significance of trends for the number of examinations and RVUs per case-mix-adjusted admission (CMAA). RESULTS. There was a significant decrease in the total number of examinations per CMAA (p < 0.001). This was due to significant decreases in the use of conventional studies (p < 0.001) and sonograms (p < 0.001), despite significant increases in the number of nuclear medicine (p = 0.046), CT (p < 0.001), and MRI (p < 0.002) examinations per CMAA. The RVUs per CMAA increased significantly (p < 0.01) during the study period. CONCLUSION. Newer imaging technologies (nuclear medicine, CT, and MRI) are replacing older ones in the evaluation of inpatients. Despite the significant decrease in the total number of imaging examinations per CMAA, we observed a significant increase in RVUs per CMAA during the 10-year study period. Understanding the impact of this change in practice on the quality of care would be useful in justifying the increasing use of these new technologies, and decreasing their inappropriate use should be a priority in efforts that focus on controlling imaging expenditures."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2978720055", "relevance_score": 231.54767, "publication_year": 2019, "title": "Ethics of Artificial Intelligence in Radiology: Summary of the Joint European and North American Multisociety Statement", "cited_by_count": 42, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Transparency (behavior)", "level": 2, "score": 0.5311429}, {"display_name": "Informatics", "level": 2, "score": 0.4616012}, {"display_name": "Dignity", "level": 2, "score": 0.4595413}, {"display_name": "Accountability", "level": 2, "score": 0.4384602}, {"display_name": "Harm", "level": 2, "score": 0.4250896}, {"display_name": "Ethical code", "level": 2, "score": 0.42258817}, {"display_name": "Engineering ethics", "level": 1, "score": 0.35289425}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.34735072}, {"display_name": "Public relations", "level": 1, "score": 0.24456081}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"This": [0, 124], "is": [1, 98, 112], "a": [2, 153], "condensed": [3], "summary": [4], "of": [5, 12, 24, 35, 41, 46, 71, 83, 132, 204, 225], "an": [6], "international": [7], "multisociety": [8], "statement": [9, 125], "on": [10], "ethics": [11, 205], "artificial": [13], "intelligence": [14], "(AI)": [15], "in": [16, 31, 48, 77, 106, 121, 134, 152], "radiology": [17, 78, 135, 196, 226], "produced": [18], "by": [19], "the": [20, 81, 144, 192, 218], "ACR,": [21], "European": [22, 33], "Society": [23, 27, 34], "Radiology,": [25], "RSNA,": [26], "for": [28, 103, 173, 182, 191, 208, 230], "Imaging": [29, 37], "Informatics": [30], "Medicine,": [32], "Medical": [36], "Informatics,": [38], "Canadian": [39], "Association": [40, 45], "Radiologists,": [42], "and": [43, 57, 67, 74, 89, 93, 141, 146, 163, 167, 176, 180, 189, 206, 217, 221, 228], "American": [44], "Physicists": [47], "Medicine.": [49], "AI": [50, 102, 120, 133, 158, 183, 209], "has": [51], "great": [52], "potential": [53], "to": [54, 114, 117, 201], "increase": [55, 80], "efficiency": [56], "accuracy": [58], "throughout": [59], "radiology,": [60], "but": [61], "it": [62], "also": [63], "carries": [64], "inherent": [65], "pitfalls": [66], "biases.": [68], "Widespread": [69], "use": [70, 131, 213, 224], "AI-based": [72], "intelligent": [73], "autonomous": [75], "systems": [76], "can": [79], "risk": [82], "systemic": [84], "errors": [85], "with": [86, 185], "high": [87], "consequence": [88], "highlights": [90, 126], "complex": [91], "ethical": [92, 130], "societal": [94], "issues.": [95], "Currently,": [96], "there": [97], "little": [99], "experience": [100], "using": [101], "patient": [104], "care": [105], "diverse": [107], "clinical": [108, 122], "settings.": [109], "Extensive": [110], "research": [111], "needed": [113], "understand": [115], "how": [116], "best": [118], "deploy": [119], "practice.": [123], "our": [127], "consensus": [128], "that": [129, 143, 210, 214], "should": [136, 159, 170, 198, 222], "promote": [137, 211], "well-being,": [138], "minimize": [139], "harm,": [140], "ensure": [142], "benefits": [145], "harms": [147], "are": [148], "distributed": [149], "among": [150], "stakeholders": [151], "just": [154], "manner.": [155], "We": [156], "believe": [157], "respect": [160], "human": [161, 187], "rights": [162], "freedoms,": [164], "including": [165], "dignity": [166], "privacy.": [168], "It": [169], "be": [171], "designed": [172], "maximum": [174], "transparency": [175], "dependability.": [177], "Ultimate": [178], "responsibility": [179], "accountability": [181], "remains": [184], "its": [186], "designers": [188], "operators": [190], "foreseeable": [193], "future.": [194], "The": [195], "community": [197], "start": [199], "now": [200], "develop": [202], "codes": [203], "practice": [207], "any": [212], "helps": [215], "patients": [216], "common": [219], "good": [220], "block": [223], "data": [227], "algorithms": [229], "financial": [231], "gain": [232], "without": [233], "those": [234], "two": [235], "attributes.": [236]}, "authors": ["J.

AI has great potential to increase efficiency and accuracy throughout radiology, but it also carries inherent pitfalls and biases. Widespread use of AI-based intelligent and autonomous systems in radiology can increase the risk of systemic errors with high consequence and highlights complex ethical and societal issues. Currently, there is little experience using AI for patient care in diverse clinical settings. Extensive research is needed to understand how to best deploy AI in clinical practice. This statement highlights our consensus that ethical use of AI in radiology should promote well-being, minimize harm, and ensure that the benefits and harms are distributed among stakeholders in a just manner. We believe AI should respect human rights and freedoms, including dignity and privacy. It should be designed for maximum transparency and dependability. Ultimate responsibility and accountability for AI remains with its human designers and operators for the foreseeable future. The radiology community should start now to develop codes of ethics and practice for AI that promote any use that helps patients and the common good and should block use of radiology data and algorithms for financial gain without those two attributes."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W1993518750", "relevance_score": 230.43988, "publication_year": 1998, "title": "Simulation model of mammographic calcifications based on the american college of radiology breast imaging reporting and data system, or BIRADS", "cited_by_count": 42, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Mammography", "level": 4, "score": 0.6563189}, {"display_name": "Breast imaging", "level": 5, "score": 0.646925}, {"display_name": "Calcification", "level": 2, "score": 0.609728}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.53171164}, {"display_name": "Digital mammography", "level": 5, "score": 0.50679594}, {"display_name": "Cluster (spacecraft)", "level": 2, "score": 0.44219917}, {"display_name": "Pixel", "level": 2, "score": 0.43649444}, {"display_name": "Medical physics", "level": 1, "score": 0.3876093}, {"display_name": "Artificial intelligence", "level": 1, "score": 0.36155188}, {"display_name": "Breast cancer", "level": 3, "score": 0.2631119}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"The": [0, 81, 112], "authors": [1], "developed": [2], "and": [3, 22, 38, 44, 53, 65, 76, 108, 143], "evaluated": [4, 87], "a": [5, 92, 122, 147], "method": [6], "for": [7, 146], "the": [8, 15, 18, 26, 36, 62, 84, 101, 105, 109, 116, 126, 130], "simulation": [9, 85, 131], "of": [10, 17, 25, 29, 46, 83, 104, 115, 125, 149], "calcification": [11, 56, 137], "clusters": [12, 57, 107, 138], "based": [13], "on": [14, 68], "guidelines": [16], "Breast": [19], "Imaging": [20], "Reporting": [21], "Data": [23], "System": [24], "American": [27], "College": [28], "Radiology.": [30], "They": [31], "aimed": [32], "to": [33, 120], "reproduce": [34], "accurately": [35], "relative": [37], "absolute": [39], "size,": [40], "shape,": [41], "location,": [42], "number,": [43], "intensity": [45], "real": [47, 110], "calcifications": [48], "associated": [49], "with": [50, 139], "both": [51], "benign": [52], "malignant": [54], "disease.Thirty": [55], "were": [58, 66], "simulated": [59, 106, 136], "by": [60, 88], "using": [61], "proposed": [63], "model": [64, 133], "superimposed": [67], "real,": [69], "negative": [70], "mammograms": [71], "digitized": [72], "at": [73], "30": [74], "microns": [75], "16": [77], "bits": [78], "per": [79], "pixel.": [80], "accuracy": [82], "was": [86, 98], "three": [89], "radiologists": [90], "in": [91, 100, 151], "blinded": [93], "study.No": [94], "statistically": [95], "significant": [96], "difference": [97], "observed": [99], "observers'": [102, 113], "evaluation": [103], "clusters.": [111], "classification": [114], "cluster": [117], "types": [118, 128], "seemed": [119], "be": [121], "good": [123], "approximation": [124], "intended": [127], "from": [129], "design.This": [132], "can": [134], "provide": [135], "well-defined": [140], "morphologic,": [141], "distributional,": [142], "contrast": [144], "characteristics": [145], "variety": [148], "applications": [150], "digital": [152], "mammography.": [153]}, "authors": ["Maria Kallergi", "Marios A.

Visual analog scale (VAS) for knee pain and the knee-specific Western Ontario Mac University (WOMAC) index for pain, stiffness, and disability were recorded. Five additional radiological features apart from those in the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) classification grading system were recorded by two authors who were blinded to the clinical diagnosis. The variables significantly associated were analyzed by linear regression model. Pain was significantly associated with increasing KL grades; physical function was nearly significant and stiffness was not. On analysis of individual radiological features, WOMAC pain was significant with subchondral sclerosis, joint space width, and tibiofemoral alignment although the correlation was week. VAS pain was significant with the latter two and with articular incongruity. Functional disability was associated with medial joint-space narrowing, tibiofemoral alignment, loose bodies, and juxta-articular osteopenia. However, in the linear regression model, pain and stiffness were significantly associated with articular incongruity and functional disability and total clinical scores with juxta-articular osteopenia. When the radiological features were extended beyond those included in KL grades, pain, stiffness, and disability correlated well with radiography; articular incongruity with pain and stiffness; and

However, there is uncertainty about the lowest dose at which excess translocations can be detected, and whether there is temporal decay of induced translocations in radiation-exposed populations. Dosimetric uncertainties can substantially alter the shape of dose-response relationships; although regression-calibration methods have been used in some datasets, these have not been applied in radio-occupational studies, where there are also complex patterns of shared and unshared errors that these methods do not account for. In this article we evaluated the relationship between estimated occupational ionizing radiation doses and chromosome translocation rates using fluorescent in situ hybridization in 238 U.S. radiologic technologists selected from a large cohort. Estimated cumulative red bone marrow doses (mean 29.3 mGy, range 0-135.7 mGy) were based on available badge-dose measurement data and on questionnaire-reported work history factors. Dosimetric assessment uncertainties were evaluated using regression calibration, Bayesian and Monte Carlo maximum likelihood methods, taking account of shared and unshared error and adjusted for overdispersion. There was a significant dose response for estimated occupational radiation exposure, adjusted for questionnaire-based personal diagnostic radiation, age, sex and study group (5.7 translocations per 100 whole genome cell equivalents per Gy, 95% CI 0.2, 11.3, P = 0.0440). A significant increasing trend with dose continued to be observed for individuals with estimated doses <100 mGy. For combined estimated occupational and personal-diagnostic-medical radiation exposures, there was a borderline-significant modifying effect of age (P = 0.0704), but little evidence (P > 0.5) of temporal decay of induced translocations. The three methods of analysis to adjust for dose uncertainty gave similar results. In summary, chromosome translocation dose-response slopes were detectable down to <100 mGy and were compatible with those observed in other radiation-exposed populations. However, there are substantial uncertainties in both occupational and other (personal-diagnostic-medical) doses that may be imperfectly taken into account in our analysis."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W4288068240", "relevance_score": 205.74036, "publication_year": 2022, "title": "RadImageNet: An Open Radiologic Deep Learning Research Dataset for Effective Transfer Learning", "cited_by_count": 42, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.5795052}, {"display_name": "Transfer of learning", "level": 2, "score": 0.4799}, {"display_name": "Artificial intelligence", "level": 1, "score": 0.43987587}, {"display_name": "Magnetic resonance imaging", "level": 2, "score": 0.42216867}, {"display_name": "Receiver operating characteristic", "level": 2, "score": 0.4163778}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"To": [0], "demonstrate": [1], "the": [2, 48, 54, 79, 82, 204, 262], "value": [3], "of": [4, 8, 103, 203], "pretraining": [5], "with": [6, 12, 66, 75, 226], "millions": [7], "radiologic": [9, 31, 232], "images": [10, 15, 43, 59, 108], "compared": [11, 74, 225], "ImageNet": [13, 76, 161, 227], "photographic": [14], "on": [16, 134, 213], "downstream": [17], "medical": [18, 107], "applications": [19], "when": [20], "using": [21, 78, 93], "transfer": [22, 131], "learning.This": [23], "retrospective": [24], "study": [25, 32, 56], "included": [26], "patients": [27, 112], "who": [28, 113], "underwent": [29, 114], "a": [30, 154, 256], "between": [33], "2005": [34], "and": [35, 44, 92, 117, 126, 147, 166, 180, 197, 211, 215], "2020": [36], "at": [37], "an": [38], "outpatient": [39], "imaging": [40], "facility.": [41], "Key": [42], "associated": [45], "labels": [46], "from": [47, 53], "studies": [49], "were": [50, 60, 73, 207], "retrospectively": [51], "extracted": [52], "original": [55], "interpretation.": [57], "These": [58], "used": [61], "for": [62, 88, 96, 119, 230, 251], "RadImageNet": [63, 71, 100, 151, 184, 205], "model": [64], "training": [65], "random": [67], "weight": [68], "initiation.": [69], "The": [70], "models": [72, 77, 152, 162, 185, 206, 221], "area": [80], "under": [81, 255], "receiver": [83], "operating": [84], "characteristic": [85], "curve": [86], "(AUC)": [87], "eight": [89], "classification": [90], "tasks": [91, 133], "Dice": [94], "scores": [95], "two": [97], "segmentation": [98], "problems.The": [99], "database": [101], "consists": [102], "1.35": [104], "million": [105], "annotated": [106], "in": [109, 266], "131": [110], "872": [111], "CT,": [115, 234], "MRI,": [116], "US": [118, 217], "musculoskeletal,": [120], "neurologic,": [121], "oncologic,": [122], "gastrointestinal,": [123], "endocrine,": [124], "abdominal,": [125], "pulmonary": [127], "pathologic": [128], "conditions.": [129], "For": [130, 171], "learning": [132], "small": [135], "datasets-thyroid": [136], "nodules": [137], "(US),": [138, 141], "breast": [139, 216], "masses": [140], "anterior": [142], "cruciate": [143], "ligament": [144], "injuries": [145], "(MRI),": [146], "meniscal": [148], "tears": [149], "(MRI)-the": [150], "demonstrated": [153, 222], "significant": [155], "advantage": [156], "(P": [157, 190], "<": [158, 191], ".001)": [159, 192], "to": [160], "(9.4%,": [163], "4.0%,": [164], "4.8%,": [165], "4.5%": [167], "AUC": [168, 189], "improvements,": [169], "respectively).": [170], "larger": [172], "datasets-pneumonia": [173], "(chest": [174], "radiography),": [175], "COVID-19": [176], "(CT),": [177, 179], "SARS-CoV-2": [178], "intracranial": [181], "hemorrhage": [182], "(CT)-the": [183], "also": [186, 261], "illustrated": [187], "improved": [188, 208], "by": [193, 209, 264], "1.9%,": [194], "6.1%,": [195], "1.7%,": [196], "0.9%,": [198], "respectively.": [199], "Additionally,": [200], "lesion": [201], "localizations": [202], "64.6%": [210], "16.4%": [212], "thyroid": [214], "datasets,": [218], "respectively.RadImageNet": [219], "pretrained": [220], "better": [223], "interpretability": [224], "models,": [228], "especially": [229], "smaller": [231], "datasets.Keywords:": [233], "MR": [235], "Imaging,": [236], "US,": [237], "Head/Neck,": [238], "Thorax,": [239], "Brain/Brain": [240], "Stem,": [241], "Evidence-based": [242], "Medicine,": [243], "Computer": [244], "Applications-General": [245], "(Informatics)": [246], "Supplemental": [247], "material": [248], "is": [249], "available": [250], "this": [252, 267], "article.": [253], "Published": [254], "CC": [257], "BY": [258], "4.0": [259], "license.See": [260], "commentary": [263], "Cadrin-Ch\u00eanevert": [265], "issue.": [268]}, "authors": ["Xueyan Mei", "Zelong Liu", "Philip M.

Key images and associated labels from the studies were retrospectively extracted from the original study interpretation. These images were used for RadImageNet model training with random weight initiation. The RadImageNet models were compared with ImageNet models using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for eight classification tasks and using Dice scores for two segmentation problems.The RadImageNet database consists of 1.35 million annotated medical images in 131 872 patients who underwent CT, MRI, and US for musculoskeletal, neurologic, oncologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, abdominal, and pulmonary pathologic conditions. For transfer learning tasks on small datasets-thyroid nodules (US), breast masses (US), anterior cruciate ligament injuries (MRI), and meniscal tears (MRI)-the RadImageNet models demonstrated a significant advantage (P < .001) to ImageNet models (9.4%, 4.0%, 4.8%, and 4.5% AUC improvements, respectively). For larger datasets-pneumonia (chest radiography), COVID-19 (CT), SARS-CoV-2 (CT), and intracranial hemorrhage (CT)-the RadImageNet models also illustrated improved AUC (P < .001) by 1.9%, 6.1%, 1.7%, and 0.9%, respectively. Additionally, lesion localizations of the RadImageNet models were improved by 64.6% and 16.4% on thyroid and breast US datasets, respectively.RadImageNet pretrained models demonstrated better interpretability compared with ImageNet models, especially for smaller radiologic datasets.Keywords: CT, MR Imaging, US, Head/Neck, Thorax, Brain/Brain Stem, Evidence-based Medicine, Computer Applications-General (Informatics) Supplemental material is available for this article.

Such abnormalities, or lesions, have collected over years and stored in hospitals' picture archiving and communication systems. However, they are basically unsorted and lack semantic annotations like type and location. In this paper, we aim to organize and explore them by learning a deep feature representation for each lesion. A large-scale and comprehensive dataset, DeepLesion, is introduced for this task. DeepLesion contains bounding boxes and size measurements of over 32K lesions. To model their similarity relationship, we leverage multiple supervision information including types, self-supervised location coordinates, and sizes. They require little manual annotation effort but describe useful attributes of the lesions. Then, a triplet network is utilized to learn lesion embeddings with a sequential sampling strategy to depict their hierarchical similarity structure. Experiments show promising qualitative and quantitative results on lesion retrieval, clustering, and classification. The learned embeddings can be further employed to build a lesion graph for various clinically useful applications. An algorithm for intra-patient lesion matching is proposed and validated with experiments."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2065071846", "relevance_score": 191.80164, "publication_year": 2008,

Examination by computerised tomographic scan revealed a right paraventricular area of diminished density involving the internal capsule, lenticular nucleus and the insula. The speech disturbance was followed by typical right-hemispheric signs and by left-channel extinction in dichotic listening tests. The aphasia cleared in two weeks, paralleled by an improvement in left-channel performance, suggesting that language recovery was dependent on right-hemispheric structures.

Demographic questions included university or private affiliation, number of residents, geographic location, and number of hospitals covered. Subject-specific items covered the amount of didactic instruction, formal evaluation of reports, and use of structured reports. A didactic activity index (DAI) was calculated as the sum of answers to domain-specific questions and tested for relation to demographic variables. We also asked about dictation methods and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) or Common Procedural Terminology (CPT) coding of examinations by radiologists.Of the 191 active radiology residencies, 151 (79%) completed the survey. Responses for hours of didactic instruction in reporting given more than a 4-year residency were distributed as follows: 0-1 = 40%, 2-4 = 46%, >4 = 14%. The percentage of resident reports formally graded was distributed as follows: 0-1 = 82%, 2-4 = 8%, >4 = 10%. The extent to which faculty-designed, structured reports were used by residents was distributed as follows: none = 16%, minimal = 25%, few = 17%, some = 33%, most = 9%. The DAI was normally distributed with a mean of 14.8 and a standard deviation of 2.4. Military programs had higher DAIs than university residencies (P = .03). There was no significant relation between any other program demographic variables and the DAI (P > .05). A substantial number of programs reported that physicians performed coding for some or most studies: ICD-9 = 30%, CPT = 26%. The dominant method for report generation was human transcription in 79% followed by speech recognition at 19%. Speech recognition penetration (departments reporting use of the technology for at least some dictation) was estimated to be 38%.In 86% of sampled radiology residencies, trainees receive no more than one hour of didactic instruction in radiology reporting per year. An aggregate measure of didactic activity about interpretative reporting was identical across all program demographic variables except that military residencies seemed to do slightly more than those located at universities."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2963441585", "relevance_score": 328.23553, "publication_year": 2016, "title": "Modelling Radiological Language with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks", "cited_by_count": 41, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Term (time)", "level": 2, "score": 0.70056343}, {"display_name": "Radiological weapon", "level": 2, "score": 0.46835962}, {"display_name": "Programming language", "level": 1, "score": 0.3339886}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Motivated": [0], "by": [1], "the": [2, 70, 86, 90, 94, 99], "need": [3], "to": [4, 33, 73, 104], "automate": [5], "medical": [6, 38], "information": [7], "extraction": [8], "from": [9, 98], "free-text": [10], "radiological": [11, 26], "reports,": [12, 67], "we": [13, 68, 110], "present": [14], "a": [15, 61, 74, 80, 115], "bi-directional": [16], "long": [17], "short-term": [18], "memory": [19], "(BiLSTM)": [20], "neural": [21], "network": [22], "architecture": [23], "for": [24, 118], "modelling": [25], "language.": [27], "The": [28], "model": [29, 72], "has": [30], "been": [31], "used": [32], "address": [34], "two": [35], "NLP": [36], "tasks:": [37], "named-entity": [39], "recognition": [40], "(NER)": [41], "and": [42, 79, 93], "negation": [43, 81], "detection.": [44], "We": [45], "investigate": [46], "whether": [47], "learning": [48], "several": [49], "types": [50], "of": [51, 64, 89], "word": [52], "embeddings": [53], "improves": [54], "BiLSTM's": [55], "performance": [56], "on": [57], "those": [58], "tasks.": [59, 121], "Using": [60], "large": [62], "dataset": [63], "chest": [65], "x-ray": [66], "compare": [69], "proposed": [71], "baseline": [75], "dictionary-based": [76], "NER": [77], "system": [78, 83], "detection": [82], "that": [84, 112], "leverages": [85], "hand-crafted": [87], "rules": [88], "NegEx": [91], "algorithm": [92], "grammatical": [95], "relations": [96], "obtained": [97], "Stanford": [100], "Dependency": [101], "Parser.": [102], "Compared": [103], "these": [105], "more": [106], "traditional": [107], "rule-based": [108], "systems,": [109], "argue": [111], "BiLSTM": [113], "offers": [114], "strong": [116], "alternative": [117], "both": [119], "our": [120]}, "authors": ["Savelie Cornegruta", "Robert Bakewell", "Samuel Withey", "Giovanni Montana"], "abstract": "Motivated by the need to automate medical information extraction from free-text radiological reports, we present a bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) neural network architecture for modelling radiological language.

We investigate whether learning several types of word embeddings improves BiLSTM's performance on those tasks.

Compared to these more traditional rule-based systems, we argue that BiLSTM offers a strong alternative for both our tasks."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W3015264156", "relevance_score": 324.87317, "publication_year": 2020, "title": "Machine Learning for Automation of Radiology Protocols for Quality and Efficiency Improvement", "cited_by_count": 41, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Workflow", "level": 2, "score": 0.7674241}, {"display_name": "Artificial intelligence", "level": 1, "score": 0.71302295}, {"display_name": "Random forest", "level": 2, "score": 0.6366379}, {"display_name": "Machine learning", "level": 1, "score": 0.6336137}, {"display_name": "Protocol (science)", "level": 3, "score": 0.63098025}, {"display_name": "Automation", "level": 2, "score": 0.6306462}, {"display_name": "Thresholding", "level": 3, "score": 0.5760718}, {"display_name": "Software deployment", "level": 2, "score": 0.51382476}, {"display_name": "Artificial neural network", "level": 2, "score": 0.49382696}, {"display_name": "Data mining", "level": 1, "score": 0.34015483}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Purpose": [0], "The": [1, 220], "aim": [2], "of": [3, 25, 106, 141, 160, 172, 183, 230, 235], "this": [4], "study": [5], "was": [6, 95, 124, 203], "to": [7, 127, 143, 205], "enhance": [8], "multispecialty": [9], "CT": [10, 55, 211], "and": [11, 16, 21, 47, 56, 68, 78, 83, 110, 130, 192, 212], "MRI": [12, 57], "protocol": [13, 116, 135, 215], "assignment": [14, 105, 136, 216, 229], "quality": [15], "efficiency": [17], "through": [18], "development,": [19], "testing,": [20], "proposed": [22], "workflow": [23, 225], "design": [24], "a": [26, 223, 250], "natural": [27], "language": [28], "processing": [29], "(NLP)\u2013based": [30], "machine": [31, 36], "learning": [32, 37], "classifier.": [33], "Methods": [34], "NLP-based": [35, 200], "classification": [38, 72, 201], "models": [39, 73], "were": [40, 74], "developed": [41], "using": [42, 148], "order": [43], "entry": [44], "input": [45], "data": [46], "radiologist-assigned": [48], "protocols": [49, 161, 231], "from": [50], "more": [51, 191], "than": [52], "18,000": [53], "unique": [54], "examinations": [58], "obtained": [59], "during": [60], "routine": [61], "clinical": [62, 111, 119], "use.": [63, 132], "k-Nearest": [64], "neighbor,": [65], "random": [66], "forest,": [67], "deep": [69, 154], "neural": [70, 155], "network": [71, 156], "evaluated": [75, 96], "at": [76, 217], "baseline": [77], "after": [79], "applying": [80], "class": [81], "frequency": [82], "confidence": [84], "thresholding": [85, 150], "techniques.": [86], "To": [87], "simulate": [88], "performance": [89, 137], "in": [90, 97, 101, 162, 179, 210, 232], "real-world": [91, 146], "deployment,": [92], "the": [93, 107, 152, 169, 174], "model": [94, 157, 175, 195], "two": [98], "operating": [99], "modes": [100], "combination:": [102], "automation": [103, 163], "(automated": [104], "top": [108], "result)": [109], "decision": [112], "support": [113], "(CDS;": [114], "top-three": [115, 244], "suggestion": [117], "for": [118, 246], "review).": [120], "Finally,": [121], "model-radiologist": [122], "discordance": [123, 184], "subjectively": [125], "reviewed": [126], "guide": [128], "explainability": [129], "safe": [131], "Results": [133], "Baseline": [134], "achieved": [138, 176], "weighted": [139], "precision": [140], "0.757": [142], "0.824.": [144], "Simulating": [145], "deployment": [147, 226], "combined": [149, 242], "techniques,": [151], "optimized": [153], "assigned": [158], "69%": [159], "mode": [164], "with": [165, 185, 238, 243], "95%": [166], "accuracy.": [167], "In": [168], "remaining": [170, 247], "31%": [171], "cases,": [173], "92%": [177], "accuracy": [178], "CDS": [180, 245], "mode.": [181], "Analysis": [182], "subspecialty": [186], "radiologist": [187], "labels": [188], "revealed": [189], "both": [190], "less": [193], "appropriate": [194], "predictions.": [196], "Conclusions": [197], "A": [198], "multiclass": [199], "algorithm": [202], "designed": [204], "drive": [206], "local": [207], "operational": [208], "improvement": [209], "MR": [213], "radiology": [214, 253], "subspecialist": [218], "quality.": [219], "results": [221], "demonstrate": [222], "simulated": [224], "enabling": [227], "automated": [228], "nearly": [233], "7": [234], "10": [236], "cases": [237, 248], "very": [239], "few": [240], "errors": [241], "supporting": [249], "high-quality,": [251], "efficient": [252], "workflow.": [254]}, "authors": ["Angad Kalra", "Amit Chakraborty", "Benjamin Fine", "Joshua J.

Methods NLP-based machine learning classification models were developed using order entry input data and radiologist-assigned protocols from more than 18,000 unique CT and MRI examinations obtained during routine clinical use. k-Nearest neighbor, random forest, and deep neural network classification models were evaluated at baseline and after applying class frequency and confidence thresholding techniques. To simulate performance in real-world deployment, the model was evaluated in two operating modes in combination: automation (automated assignment of the top result) and clinical decision support (CDS; top-three protocol suggestion for clinical review). Finally, model-radiologist discordance was subjectively reviewed to guide explainability and safe use. Results Baseline protocol assignment performance achieved weighted precision of 0.757 to 0.824. Simulating real-world deployment using combined thresholding techniques, the optimized deep neural network model assigned 69% of protocols in automation mode with 95% accuracy. In the remaining 31% of cases, the model achieved 92% accuracy in CDS mode. Analysis of discordance with subspecialty radiologist labels revealed both more and less appropriate model predictions. Conclusions A multiclass NLP-based classification algorithm was designed to drive local operational improvement in CT and MR radiology protocol assignment at subspecialist quality. The results demonstrate a simulated workflow deployment enabling automated assignment of protocols in nearly 7 of 10 cases with very few errors combined with top-three CDS for remaining cases supporting a high-quality, efficient radiology workflow."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2044607677", "relevance_score": 285.77316, "publication_year": 2010, "title": "The role of interventional radiology in trauma", "cited_by_count": 41, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Interventional radiology", "level": 2, "score": 0.6322161}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.44911727}, {"display_name": "Medical physics", "level": 1, "score": 0.3452525}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"####": [0], "Summary": [1], "points\n\nMost": [2], "preventable": [3], "deaths": [4], "from": [5, 38, 74, 89], "trauma": [6, 71], "are": [7, 108, 177], "caused": [8, 160], "by": [9, 161, 193], "unrecognised": [10], "and": [11, 23, 33, 47, 50, 66, 93, 129], "therefore": [12], "untreated": [13], "haemorrhage,": [14], "particularly": [15], "in": [16, 100, 117, 155, 179], "the": [17, 24, 48, 58, 97, 121, 146, 149, 156, 185], "abdomen.": [18], "Haemorrhage": [19], "causes": [20], "early": [21], "deaths,": [22], "associated": [25], "hypovolaemic": [26], "shock": [27], "leads": [28], "to": [29, 35, 56, 96, 144, 171, 189], "secondary": [30], "brain": [31], "injury": [32], "contributes": [34], "late": [36], "death": [37], "multiorgan": [39], "failure.1": [40], "Early": [41], "management": [42, 157], "is": [43, 84, 94, 127, 188], "focused": [44], "on": [45, 87], "resuscitation": [46], "diagnosis": [49], "treatment": [51], "of": [52, 63, 69, 77, 103, 114, 123, 151, 158], "life": [53], "threatening": [54], "bleeding": [55, 195], "prevent": [57], "lethal": [59], "metabolic": [60], "disturbance": [61], "triad": [62], "acidosis,": [64], "hypothermia,": [65], "coagulopathy.2\n\nMany": [67], "aspects": [68], "immediate": [70], "care": [72], "suffer": [73], "a": [75], "lack": [76], "high": [78], "quality": [79], "prospective": [80, 110], "research.": [81], "This": [82, 141], "review": [83, 142], "based": [85], "predominantly": [86], "evidence": [88, 126, 138, 147], "retrospective": [90], "cohort": [91], "series": [92], "subject": [95], "limitations": [98], "inherent": [99], "this": [101], "type": [102], "level": [104, 124, 136], "2": [105, 125], "research.3": [106], "There": [107], "no": [109, 134], "randomised": [111], "controlled": [112], "trials": [113], "interventional": [115, 152], "radiology": [116, 165], "major": [118], "trauma.": [119], "Although": [120], "volume": [122], "substantial": [128], "contains": [130], "few": [131], "contradictory": [132], "findings,": [133], "robust": [135], "1": [137], "yet": [139], "exists.": [140], "aims": [143], "summarise": [145], "supporting": [148], "use": [150], "radiological": [153], "techniques": [154, 170, 176], "haemorrhage": [159, 192], "blunt": [162], "abdominal": [163], "trauma.\n\nInterventional": [164], "uses": [166], "minimally": [167], "invasive": [168], "endovascular": [169, 191], "stem": [172], "haemorrhage.": [173], "Endovascular": [174], "haemostasic": [175], "established": [178], "non-trauma": [180], "clinical": [181], "scenarios.": [182], "In": [183], "trauma,": [184], "main": [186], "application": [187], "control": [190], "blocking": [194], "vessels": [196], "(transcatheter": [197], "arterial": [198], "embolisation": [199], "(fig": [200], "1\u21d3)": [201], "or": [202], "relining": [203], "\u2026": [204]}, "authors": ["Ian Zealley", "S.

Haemorrhage causes early deaths, and the associated hypovolaemic shock leads to secondary brain injury and contributes to late death from multiorgan failure.1 Early management is focused on resuscitation and the diagnosis and treatment of life threatening bleeding to prevent the lethal metabolic disturbance triad of acidosis, hypothermia, and coagulopathy.2\n\nMany aspects of immediate trauma care suffer from a lack of high quality prospective research. This review is based predominantly on evidence from retrospective cohort series and is subject to the limitations inherent in this type of level 2 research.3 There are no prospective randomised controlled trials of interventional radiology in major trauma. Although the volume of level 2 evidence is substantial and contains few contradictory findings, no robust level 1 evidence yet exists. This review aims to summarise the evidence supporting the use of interventional radiological techniques in the management of haemorrhage caused by blunt abdominal trauma.\n\nInterventional radiology uses minimally invasive endovascular techniques to stem haemorrhage. Endovascular haemostasic techniques are established in non-trauma clinical scenarios. In trauma, the main application is to control endovascular haemorrhage by blocking bleeding vessels (transcatheter arterial embolisation (fig 1\u21d3) or relining \u2026"}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2315492488", "relevance_score": 284.07092, "publication_year": 2010, "title": "Early radiological outcome of ultrasound monitoring in infants with developmental dysplasia of the hips", "cited_by_count": 41, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Radiological weapon", "level": 2, "score": 0.81558174}, {"display_name": "Ultrasound", "level": 2, "score": 0.7836046}, {"display_name": "Radiography", "level": 2, "score": 0.669575}, {"display_name": "Dysplasia", "level": 2, "score": 0.5983193}, {"display_name": "Pelvis", "level": 2, "score": 0.5840439}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.5103821}, {"display_name": "Surgery", "level": 1, "score": 0.34785986}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"The": [0, 117, 137], "purpose": [1], "of": [2, 15, 18, 34, 42, 55, 61, 112, 129, 170, 193, 225, 239, 248], "this": [3], "study": [4], "was": [5, 27, 91, 115, 120, 165, 197], "to": [6, 23, 81, 87, 125, 190], "evaluate": [7], "the": [8, 19, 31, 40, 46, 49, 53, 58, 82, 100, 113, 126, 130, 142, 148, 168, 191, 202, 206, 237, 245], "early": [9], "radiological": [10, 171, 207, 223, 252], "outcome": [11, 208], "after": [12, 212], "ultrasound-monitored": [13, 56, 214], "treatment": [14], "developmental": [16], "dysplasia": [17, 44, 179, 188, 220, 250], "hip": [20, 131, 227], "(DDH)": [21], "and": [22, 39, 85, 122, 180, 205, 244], "examine": [24], "whether": [25], "there": [26, 196], "a": [28, 216], "correlation": [29, 200, 235], "between": [30, 201, 236], "initial": [32], "severity": [33, 41, 238], "DDH,": [35], "measured": [36, 121, 151, 241], "by": [37, 135, 141, 242], "ultrasound,": [38], "residual": [43, 178, 187, 219, 249], "on": [45], "radiograph": [47, 111], "at": [48, 152, 167, 209, 251], "first": [50], "follow-up.": [51, 154, 210, 253], "At": [52, 99], "beginning": [54], "treatment,": [57, 215], "sonographic": [59], "findings": [60, 96, 139], "90": [62], "children": [63, 102], "(72": [64], "girls,": [65], "18": [66], "boys,": [67], "mean": [68], "age": [69, 106], "7.2": [70], "weeks)": [71], "with": [72, 147], "DDH": [73, 240], "(29": [74], "unilateral,": [75], "61": [76], "bilateral)": [77], "were": [78, 97, 145, 160], "staged": [79], "according": [80, 124, 189], "Graf": [83, 143, 203], "classification": [84, 144, 204], "assigned": [86], "four": [88], "categories.": [89], "Treatment": [90], "continued": [92], "until": [93], "normal": [94, 127, 156], "ultrasound": [95, 138, 159, 243], "reached.": [98], "time": [101, 169], "started": [103], "walking": [104], "(mean": [105], "14.8": [107], "months),": [108], "an": [109], "anteroposterior": [110], "pelvis": [114], "performed.": [116], "acetabular": [118, 149], "index": [119, 150], "classified": [123], "values": [128, 157], "joint,": [132], "as": [133], "described": [134], "T\u00f6nnis.": [136, 194], "expressed": [140], "compared": [146], "radiographic": [153], "Although": [155], "in": [158], "reached": [161], "before": [162], "abduction": [163], "splinting": [164], "discontinued,": [166], "follow-up,": [172], "59": [173], "hips": [174, 183], "(32.8%)": [175], "showed": [176, 185], "mild": [177], "another": [181], "53": [182], "(29.4%)": [184], "severe": [186], "criteria": [192], "Statistically,": [195], "no": [198, 234], "significant": [199], "Even": [211], "successful": [213], "risk": [217], "for": [218], "remains.": [221], "Therefore,": [222], "follow-up": [224], "every": [226], "treated": [228], "once": [229], "is": [230], "necessary.": [231], "We": [232], "found": [233], "subsequent": [246], "presence": [247]}, "authors": ["Daniel Dornacher", "Balkan Cakir", "Heiko Reichel", "Manfred Nelitz"], "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the early radiological outcome after ultrasound-monitored treatment of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) and to examine whether there was a correlation between the initial severity of DDH, measured by ultrasound, and the severity of residual dysplasia on the radiograph at the first follow-up. At the beginning of ultrasound-monitored treatment, the sonographic findings of 90 children (72 girls, 18 boys, mean age 7.2 weeks) with DDH (29 unilateral, 61 bilateral) were staged according to the Graf classification and assigned to four categories. Treatment was continued until normal ultrasound findings were reached. At the time children started walking (mean age 14.8 months), an anteroposterior radiograph of the pelvis was performed. The acetabular index was measured and classified according to the normal values of the hip joint, as described by T\u00f6nnis. The ultrasound findings expressed by the Graf classification were compared with the acetabular index measured at radiographic follow-up. Although normal values in ultrasound were reached before abduction splinting was discontinued, at the time of radiological follow-up, 59 hips (32.8%) showed mild residual dysplasia and another 53 hips (29.4%) showed severe residual dysplasia according to the criteria of T\u00f6nnis. Statistically, there was no significant correlation between the Graf classification and the radiological outcome at follow-up.

Disease distribution among patients, within a given patient, or even in individual bones is unpredictable. The femur is the most commonly and severely affected bone and hence most useful for radiographic screening of possible patients. Radiographs provide a meaningful assessment of disease activity and extent. The severity of symptoms is generally proportionate to severity of involvement shown by roentgenography.

Whilst there are immediate advantages to this approach (pragmatism, consistency with other approaches in use for man and biota), there are also clear limitations, especially in a longer run perspective, that need to be acknowledged and further considered. One can mention a few: uncertainties generated by the need for various extrapolations (from lower to higher levels of biological organisation, \u2026), various features missed such as potential ecological impact through impairment of ecosystem processes, trans-generational impacts as mediated through genomic instability, indirect effects mediated through trophic interactions or disruption of ecological balances,\u2026 Such limitations have already been faced in other fields of environmental protection against other stressors, pushing a number of environment professionals to assign stronger emphasis on more systemic approaches. This review discusses the advantages and limitations of the current approach designed for the radiological protection of non-human biota in the broader context of environment protection as a whole, with especial reference to upcoming trends and evolutions.

The description of Egyptian mummification commonly used in the popular and academic literature is derived largely from accounts by Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus. However, this normative description does not acknowledge the existence of a wide range of mummification techniques practiced and so stifles the study of geographic and chronological changes in the practice and their causes. Therefore, the goal of this study is to use the classical description as a hypothesis for empirical testing, using published literature and primary radiographic data, with a specific focus on the practice of excerebration. Three primary treatments of the brain in mummification, and their variation over time and across social strata, are discussed in relation to their treatment in the literature, their radiological indicators, and their technical considerations. In order to examine Egyptian mummy excerebration, this study makes use of two samples: (1) a literature-based sample of 125 mummies, and (2) a sample of 6 mummies examined directly using computed tomography. In spite of an apparent high degree of variability, the literature continues to focus on modern and classical stereotypes rather than the rich variability in the Egyptian mummification tradition. Detailed, large-scale examination of this and other mummification traditions, and their meanings, is required to further our understanding of this important early complex society."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W1995702672", "relevance_score": 224.08463, "publication_year": 1991, "title": "Combined surgical and interventional radiological approach for complex benign biliary tract obstruction", "cited_by_count": 41, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Anastomosis", "level": 2, "score": 0.6714607}, {"display_name": "Biliary tract", "level": 2, "score": 0.5673484}, {"display_name": "Portal hypertension", "level": 3, "score": 0.5412123}, {"display_name": "Radiological weapon", "level": 2, "score": 0.5387223}, {"display_name": "Surgery", "level": 1, "score": 0.5288922}, {"display_name": "Biliary disease", "level": 2, "score": 0.4971781}, {"display_name": "Bile duct", "level": 2, "score": 0.48829722}, {"display_name": "Common bile duct", "level": 2, "score": 0.45520097}, {"display_name": "Jejunum", "level": 2, "score": 0.43836015}, {"display_name": "Atrophy", "level": 2, "score": 0.42212772}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.34975612}, {"display_name": "Gastroenterology", "level": 1, "score": 0.2459296}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"In": [0], "patients": [1, 88, 99, 131, 160], "with": [2], "complicated": [3], "high": [4], "benign": [5, 80], "biliary": [6], "strictures": [7, 103, 107, 127], "surgical": [8, 29, 44, 162], "technique": [9], "alone": [10], "cannot": [11], "exclude": [12], "the": [13, 40, 58, 62, 92], "possibility": [14], "of": [15, 57, 85, 96, 120, 122, 124, 150], "recurrent": [16], "problems,": [17], "and": [18, 23, 53, 104, 140, 153], "hepatic": [19, 112], "atrophy/hypertrophy,": [20], "portal": [21], "hypertension": [22], "intrahepatic": [24], "stones": [25], "may": [26], "all": [27], "complicate": [28], "management.": [30], "A": [31, 117], "multidisciplinary": [32], "approach": [33], "to": [34, 61, 65], "these": [35, 86, 97], "complex": [36, 101], "cases,": [37], "which": [38], "minimizes": [39], "need": [41], "for": [42, 68, 79], "repeated": [43], "interventions,": [45], "has": [46], "been": [47], "pursued.": [48], "Roux-en-Y": [49], "hepaticojejunostomy": [50], "was": [51], "performed": [52], "an": [54], "extended": [55], "limb": [56], "jejunum": [59], "brought": [60], "abdominal": [63], "wall": [64], "allow": [66], "access": [67], "later": [69], "radiological": [70], "intervention.": [71], "Over": [72], "a": [73, 147], "30-month": [74], "period": [75], "58": [76, 87], "biliary-enteric": [77], "anastomoses": [78], "disease": [81], "were": [82, 89, 132, 144, 164], "performed.": [83], "Seventeen": [84], "managed": [90], "using": [91], "combined": [93], "approach.": [94], "Ten": [95], "17": [98], "had": [100, 106], "postcholecystectomy": [102], "seven": [105], "resulting": [108], "from": [109], "inflammatory": [110], "disease,": [111], "resection": [113], "or": [114], "congenital": [115], "problems.": [116], "new": [118], "classification": [119], "results": [121], "management": [123], "bile": [125], "duct": [126], "is": [128], "proposed.": [129], "Seven": [130], "classified": [133], "as": [134], "'excellent',": [135], "six": [136], "'good',": [137], "two": [138, 141], "'fair'": [139], "'poor'.": [142], "Results": [143], "obtained": [145], "at": [146], "mean": [148], "follow-up": [149], "16": [151], "months": [152], "it": [154], "seems": [155], "likely": [156], "that": [157], "in": [158], "some": [159], "major": [161], "reinterventions": [163], "avoided.": [165]}, "authors": ["W Schweizer", "Jeffrey B.

The Research Consortium for Medical Image Analysis (RECOMIA), a not-for-profit organisation, has developed an online platform to facilitate collaboration between medical researchers and AI researchers. The aim is to minimise the time and effort researchers need to spend on technical aspects, such as transfer, display, and annotation of images, as well as legal aspects, such as de-identification. The purpose of this article is to present the RECOMIA platform and its AI-based tools for organ segmentation in computed tomography (CT), which can be used for extraction of standardised uptake values from the corresponding positron emission tomography (PET) image. Results The RECOMIA platform includes modules for (1) local de-identification of medical images, (2) secure transfer of images to the cloud-based platform, (3) display functions available using a standard web browser, (4) tools for manual annotation of organs or pathology in the images, (5) deep learning-based tools for organ segmentation or other customised analyses, (6) tools for quantification of segmented volumes, and (7) an export function for the quantitative results. The AI-based tool for organ segmentation in CT currently handles 100 organs (77 bones and 23 soft tissue organs). The segmentation is based on two convolutional neural networks (CNNs): one network to handle organs with multiple similar instances, such as vertebrae and ribs, and one network for all other organs. The CNNs have been trained using CT studies from 339 patients. Experienced radiologists annotated organs in the CT studies. The performance of the segmentation tool, measured as mean Dice index on a manually annotated test set, with 10 representative organs, was 0.93 for all foreground voxels, and the mean Dice index over the organs were 0.86 (0.82 for the soft tissue organs and 0.90 for the bones). Conclusion The paper presents a platform that provides deep learning-based tools that can perform basic organ segmentations in CT, which can then be used to automatically obtain the different measurement in the corresponding PET image. The RECOMIA platform is available on request at www.recomia.org for research purposes."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W1554565956", "relevance_score": 204.97957, "publication_year": 2015, "title": "Diagnostic Radiology Resident and Fellow Workloads: A 12-Year Longitudinal Trend Analysis Using National Medicare Aggregate Claims Data", "cited_by_count": 41, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Medicare Part B", "level": 3, "score": 0.81558335}, {"display_name": "Mammography", "level": 4, "score": 0.6073539}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.52993953}, {"display_name": "Radiography", "level": 2, "score": 0.47940394}, {"display_name": "Nuclear medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.4482838}, {"display_name": "Medical physics", "level": 1, "score": 0.3709969}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"The": [0], "aim": [1], "of": [2, 20, 144, 209], "this": [3, 162], "study": [4], "was": [5, 23], "to": [6, 25, 34, 67, 80, 93, 100, 107, 114, 122, 149, 157, 169, 177, 184, 191, 199], "evaluate": [7], "changes": [8], "in": [9, 16, 237], "diagnostic": [10, 63, 145, 214], "radiology": [11, 64, 215], "resident": [12], "and": [13, 37, 46, 51, 117, 196, 205, 217, 242], "fellow": [14], "workloads": [15], "recent": [17], "years.Berenson-Eggers": [18], "Type": [19], "Service": [21, 83], "categorization": [22], "applied": [24], "Medicare": [26, 69, 150, 220], "Part": [27, 151], "B": [28, 152], "Physician/Supplier": [29], "Procedure": [30], "Summary": [31], "Master": [32], "Files": [33], "identify": [35], "total": [36], "resident-specific": [38], "claims": [39, 70], "for": [40, 61, 71, 89, 96, 103, 110, 118, 173, 180, 187, 194, 202, 233], "radiologist": [41], "imaging": [42, 72, 210], "services": [43, 73, 127, 146, 240], "between": [44], "1998": [45, 66, 204], "2010.": [47], "Data": [48], "were": [49, 58], "extracted": [50], "subgroup": [52], "analytics": [53], "performed": [54], "by": [55, 75, 213, 225, 234], "modality.": [56], "Volumes": [57], "annually": [59, 148], "normalized": [60], "active": [62], "trainees.From": [65], "2010,": [68, 206], "rendered": [74, 147], "radiologists": [76], "increased": [77, 85, 129, 154, 222], "from": [78, 91, 98, 105, 112, 120, 155, 167, 175, 182, 189, 197], "78,901,255": [79], "105,252,599": [81], "(+33.4%).": [82], "volumes": [84], "across": [86], "all": [87], "modalities:": [88], "radiography": [90], "55,661,683": [92], "59,654,659": [94], "(+7.2%),": [95], "mammography": [97], "5,780,624": [99], "6,570,673": [101], "(+13.7%),": [102], "ultrasound": [104], "5,851,864": [106], "9,853,459": [108], "(+68.4%),": [109], "CT": [111], "9,351,780": [113], "22,527,488": [115], "(+140.9%),": [116], "MR": [119], "2,255,304": [121], "6,646,320": [123], "(+194.7%).": [124], "Total": [125], "trainee": [126, 138], "nationally": [128], "3": [130], "times": [131], "as": [132], "rapidly.": [133], "On": [134], "an": [135, 164], "average": [136, 142, 165, 224], "per": [137, 227], "basis,": [139], "however,": [140], "the": [141, 207], "number": [143, 208], "beneficiaries": [153, 221], "499": [156], "629": [158], "(+26.1%).": [159], "By": [160], "modality,": [161], "represents": [163], "change": [166], "333": [168], "306": [170], "examinations": [171, 211], "(-8.1%)": [172], "radiography,": [174], "20": [176, 198], "18": [178], "(-7.4%)": [179], "mammography,": [181], "37": [183], "56": [185], "(+49.7%)": [186], "ultrasound,": [188], "88": [190], "202": [192], "(+129.1%)": [193], "CT,": [195], "47": [200], "(+132.0%)": [201], "MRI.Between": [203], "interpreted": [212], "residents": [216], "fellows": [218], "on": [219, 223], "26%": [226], "trainee,": [228], "with": [229], "growth": [230], "largely": [231], "accounted": [232], "disproportionate": [235], "increases": [236], "more": [238], "complex": [239], "(CT": [241], "MRI).": [243]}, "authors": ["Falgun H.

Data were extracted and subgroup analytics performed by modality. Volumes were annually normalized for active diagnostic radiology trainees.From 1998 to 2010, Medicare claims for imaging services rendered by radiologists increased from 78,901,255 to 105,252,599 (+33.4%). Service volumes increased across all modalities: for radiography from 55,661,683 to 59,654,659 (+7.2%), for mammography from 5,780,624 to 6,570,673 (+13.7%), for ultrasound from 5,851,864 to 9,853,459 (+68.4%), for CT from 9,351,780 to 22,527,488 (+140.9%), and for MR from 2,255,304 to 6,646,320 (+194.7%). Total trainee services nationally increased 3 times as rapidly. On an average per trainee basis, however, the average number of diagnostic services rendered annually to Medicare Part B beneficiaries increased from 499 to 629 (+26.1%). By modality, this represents an average change from 333 to 306 examinations (-8.1%) for radiography, from 20 to 18 (-7.4%) for mammography, from 37 to 56 (+49.7%) for ultrasound, from 88 to 202 (+129.1%) for CT, and from 20 to 47 (+132.0%) for MRI.Between 1998 and 2010, the number of imaging examinations interpreted by diagnostic radiology residents and fellows on Medicare beneficiaries increased on average by 26% per trainee, with growth largely accounted for by disproportionate increases in more complex services (CT and MRI)."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2005771601",

A child/teenager was defined as anyone younger than the age of 20 years.Participants were given detailed dysmorphology, dermatological, and radiographic examinations; however, a complete panel of examinations was not performed on every study participant due to logistical constraints. Radiography included the skull, ribs, spine, hands, feet, long bones, and pelvis. Dental evaluation included a panorex film. Brain imaging was obtained with magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scans. Females underwent a pelvic ultrasound.A diagnosis of NBCCS was established if two major or one major and two minor criteria were satisfied. Major diagnostic criteria included more than two BCCs or at least one before the age of 20, keratocysts of the jaw, palmar/plantar pits, lamellar calcification of falx cerebri, rib anomalies, ovarian fibromas, medulloblastoma, and flame-shaped lucencies of the phalanges. Minor criteria included spina bifida occulta and other vertebral anomalies, brachymetacarpaly, hypertelorism/telecanthus, and frontal bossing.5.Kimonis V.E. Goldstein A.M. Pastakia B.

A cross-table analysis of the clinical features in affected and unaffected individuals in both the <20 and >20 years age groups was performed, in addition to calculating means for continuous variables. Statistical significance (using the Pearson test for categorical variables and the t-test for continuous variables) was demonstrated when a P value of <0.05 was obtained. Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis was used to evaluate the probability of onset at different ages for several clinical findings.ResultsWe studied 26 families with 30 affected children and teenagers ranging in age from 4 months to 19 years (mean 11.3 years; male to female ratio 1:1). Twenty-five unaffected siblings from these families were also evaluated as a comparison population. Their ages ranged from 5.5 to 19.5 years (mean 12.1 years; male to female ratio 1:1.8). Table 1 provides a summary of the demographic characteristics of the study population.Table 1Demographic characteristics of the study populationAs compared with the affected adults (ranging in age from 20 to 87 years), not surprisingly, affected children and teenagers displayed lower frequencies of the major clinical features. When the population studied was segregated between those <20 years and \u226520 years of age, 50% of children and teenagers (<20 years) and 82% of those \u226520 years had one or more BCCs. Jaw cysts occurred in 60% of children/teenagers and 81% of adults, with the number of cysts ranging from 1 to 6 (median 3) and 1 to 28 (median 5), respectively. Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis of the entire NBCC population (including Caucasian, African-American, and Hispanic families) studied indicated that 50% of individuals developed their first BCC by age 21.5 years and their first jaw cyst by 15 years. Palmar and plantar pits (Figure 1) were seen at the same high frequency in both children/teenagers and adults (90 and 86%, respectively). The data are summarized in Figure 2.Figure 1Palmar and plantar pits in juvenile patients with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 2Observed frequencies of the major clinical features in children/teenagers and adults with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As compared with their unaffected siblings, there was a statistically significant difference in the presence of craniofacial abnormalities such as macrocephaly, frontal bossing, strabismus, and palate abnormalities (excluding cleft palate) in affected children/teenagers. Hypertelorism and synophrys were observed in 38% of affected children/teenagers and 15 and 13%, respectively, in unaffected siblings. This finding approached, but did not meet, statistical significance (P = 0.08). (Figures 1 and 3 illustrate some of the characteristic features of juvenile NBCCS in affected young individuals.) Radiological features that were observed to occur in a significantly higher frequency in affected children and teenagers included bridged sella, ectopic calcification of the falx, and bifid ribs. Sprengel deformities were also observed more frequently in affected children and teenagers (Table 2).Figure 3Craniofacial manifestations of nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS).

These include ectopic calcification of the tentorium cerebellum, fused or splayed ribs, hemivertebrae, fusion of the vertebral bodies, flame-shaped lucencies, modeling defects of the hands and feet, and pectus deformities (Table 2). Interestingly, the frequencies of scoliosis, cervical ribs, absence of ribs or rudimentary ribs, spina bifida occulta, or short fourth metacarpal were not increased in affected individuals as compared with their unaffected siblings. Table 2 provides a more complete overview of the data.DiscussionWe studied minor and major clinical features of NBCCS in 30 children/teenagers and 75 adults with NBCCS from 26 families in an attempt to improve the current diagnostic criteria in the pediatric population. We found that many affected children/teenagers lacked major features such as BCCs, jaw cysts, and falx calcification. The presence of palmar/plantar pits was a useful diagnostic feature as it was displayed at the same high frequency in children/teenagers and adults. Other important manifestations in the affected children and teenagers include palatal abnormalities, macrocephaly, and bridged sella, all of which were prevalent in at least 50% of young patients.Molecular testing was performed earlier in 199817.Bale S.J.

They determined that there was no genotype/phenotype correlation, and also found that the age at which BCCs first develop and the total number of BCCs had no association with the presence or absence of a mutation, or the mutation type. Although it can be argued that the combination of detailed physical and radiographical examination in children suspected of NBCCS approximates the cost of DNA testing, in reality, the reported detection frequency falls between 50 and 85%.25.Evans DG, Farndon PA.

Therefore, thorough clinical diagnostic criteria are critical. Our study compared clinical features in affected individuals with their unaffected siblings and provides useful guidelines on the utility of clinical evaluations in the diagnosis of NBCCS.Kimonis et al.5.Kimonis V.E.

Palmar and plantar pits, in conjunction with radiological and other clinical data, are more indicative of the disorder than BCCs in young individuals.14.Kimonis V.E. Mehta S.G. Digiovanna J.J. Bale S.J. Pastakia B.

Important radiological signs include ectopic calcification of the falx with an increasing incidence over time, bridged sella, bifid ribs, hemivertebrae, fusion of the vertebral bodies, flame-shaped lucencies of the hands and feet, and modeling defects. Although not statistically significant in our study due to small sample size, many of these features are notable in that they were present only in affected teenagers. Their occurrence therefore lends suspicion to a diagnosis of NBCCS.To maximize these diagnostic indicators, young individuals at risk should undergo careful clinical evaluations for palmar/plantar pits and suggestive dysmorphic features, as well as baseline radiological examinations, particularly of the skull, chest and ribs, spine, and hands and feet. Regular dental surveillance, including imaging of the jaw, should be obtained annually in at-risk individuals to identify jaw cysts. Of note, care must be taken to avoid overexposure to radiation, which has been shown to cause increased tumor growth in affected individuals.5.Kimonis V.E. Goldstein A.M. Pastakia B.

In the absence of major features such as BCCs, jaw cysts, or falx calcification, screening for palmar/plantar pits, craniofacial features, specific radiological manifestations, and molecular testing of the PTCH gene facilitates the diagnosis in children and teenagers. Increased appreciation of the prevalence and likely predictors of NBCCS are important, either as an alternative or prescreening for molecular testing. Improved diagnostic indicators are especially important in children/teenagers because of the potential of avoiding complications of BCC.DisclosureS.J.B. is an employee and stockholder in GeneDx, which provides genetic testing for Gorlin syndrome.

SIR defines acute proximal PE as new main or lobar emboli identified on radiographic imaging within 14 days of PE symptoms. In addition, SIR encourages the investigative use of CDT and new endovascular techniques in prospective outcomes studies and clinical trials, with particular attention to patients with acute submassive (ie, intermediate-risk) PE. Acute PE is a common life-threatening condition that represents a severe manifestation along the spectrum of venous thromboembolic disease, and PE is the third leading cause of cardiovascular mortality in the United States (1Mozaffarian D. Benjamin E.J. Go A.S. et al.Heart disease and stroke statistics\u20132015 update: a report from the American Heart Association.Circulation. 2015; 131: e29-e322Crossref PubMed Scopus (5711) Google Scholar). Acute PE is currently classified into three categories: low-risk, submassive (ie, intermediate-risk), and massive (ie, high-risk) (2Jaff M.R. McMurtry M.S. Archer S.L. et al.Management of massive and submassive pulmonary embolism, iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis, and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association.Circulation. 2011; 123: 1788-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar). Low-risk PE is defined by the absence of right heart strain and systemic arterial hypotension. The majority of patients diagnosed with PE present to the hospital without hypotension or heart strain, and these patients with low-risk PE (< 1% short-term mortality rate) can be successfully managed with prompt initiation of therapeutic anticoagulation (3Kearon C. Akl E.A. Ornelas J. et al.Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: CHEST guideline and expert panel report.Chest. 2016; 149: 315-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3364) Google Scholar). Submassive or intermediate-risk PE is defined by the presence of right heart dysfunction in the setting of normal blood pressure, and this represents as many as 25% of all cases of acute PE. Currently, the greatest uncertainty in the PE treatment algorithm concerns the risk stratification and management of submassive PE. A recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) (4Meyer G. Vicaut E. Danays T. et al.Fibrinolysis for patients with intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism.N Engl J Med. 2014; 370: 1402-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar) in patients with submassive PE demonstrated a 5.6% rate of clinical deterioration (ie, death or hemodynamic decompensation) within 7 days and a 3% 30-day mortality rate with anticoagulation alone. In interpreting these findings against the background of previous studies, it should be noted that, for conventional and aggressive PE therapies, contemporary studies report lower mortality rates than older studies. In addition, RCTs have tended to report lower mortality rates than observational studies, which may result in part from selection of healthier populations (ie, strict inclusion/exclusion criteria) and closer subject monitoring in the RCTs. As such, earlier observational studies reported higher rates of mortality and rapid clinical deterioration in submassive PE populations treated with anticoagulation alone (5Goldhaber S.Z. Visani L.

Nevertheless, considering all the studies to date, it is clear that the estimated mortality risk from submassive PE is substantially higher than that associated with low-risk PE, but that the vast majority of patients survive, perhaps as a result of contemporary advances in medical care (5Goldhaber S.Z.

Massive or high-risk PE is characterized by the presence of sustained systemic arterial hypotension defined by a systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg for at least 15 minutes or requiring inotropic support (2Jaff M.R.

As a result of the critical nature of high-risk PE, there is a current consensus that aggressive clot removal strategies be considered including systemic thrombolysis, CDT, and/or surgical embolectomy in select patients depending on risk/benefit assessment, presence of contraindications to such therapies, and available local expertise (2Jaff M.R.

Although systemic thrombolysis is currently indicated for the treatment of acute massive PE, many patients cannot receive systemic thrombolytic therapy because of contraindications. Even when patients with acute PE are prescreened for absolute contraindications, the rate of major hemorrhage associated with systemic thrombolysis has been estimated at 9.2%, with a 1.5% risk of intracranial hemorrhage reported in a metaanalysis of RCTs (7Chatterjee S.

Although systemic thrombolysis can be initiated in a shorter time frame than CDT, the full dose generally takes 2 hours to deliver, and possible advantages of CDT could include the ability to use a lower thrombolytic drug dose and obtain faster lysis as a result of the targeted intrathrombus drug delivery and the addition of mechanical treatment (ie, pharmacomechanical CDT) (3Kearon C.

In a meta-analysis of 594 patients with acute massive PE treated with modern CDT (ie, use of low-profile devices < 10 F, mechanical fragmentation, and/or aspiration of emboli with or without the use of thrombolytic drugs) (12Kuo W.T. Gould M.K. Louie J.D. Rosenberg J.K. Sze D.Y. Hofmann L.V.

The analysis was limited because most of the identified studies were retrospective in design, most were small with heterogenous methods, and there were no randomized trials (although RCTs might pose an ethical challenge in patients with massive PE); nevertheless, there was no significant difference in clinical success rates between the prospective and retrospective study groups. In the same study (12Kuo W.T. Gould M.K. Louie J.D. Rosenberg J.K. Sze D.Y. Hofmann L.V.

In addition, the estimated rate of major complications associated with modern CDT was 2.4%, and most complications were attributed to the use of rheolytic thrombectomy with the use of an AngioJet (Possis Medical, Minneapolis, Minnesota) device (12Kuo W.T.

The highest complication rates occurred in the 68 patients who underwent CDT with the AngioJet rheolytic thrombectomy device, including 27 minor complications (40%) and 19 major complications (28%), with 5 procedure-related deaths (12Kuo W.T.

In this meta-analysis (12Kuo W.T. Gould M.K. Louie J.D. Rosenberg J.K. Sze D.Y. Hofmann L.V.

Minneapolis: Possis Medical, 2008.Google Scholar), stating \u201cThere are reports of serious adverse events, including death, associated with cases where the [AngioJet] catheter was used in treatment of pulmonary embolism.\u201d Among patients with submassive PE, the initial goal of treatment escalation with thrombolysis is to reduce mortality from PE without increasing the risk of treatment-related complications. Although a recent meta-analysis of randomized trials (7Chatterjee S. Chakraborty A. Weinberg I. et al.Thrombolysis for pulmonary embolism and risk of all-cause mortality, major bleeding, and intracranial hemorrhage: a meta-analysis.JAMA. 2014; 311: 2414-2421Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) demonstrated a survival benefit with use of systemic thrombolytic therapy in submassive PE, these data also revealed a much higher risk of major bleeding complications compared with anticoagulation alone. Therefore, the risk-to-benefit ratio of systemic thrombolysis in the submassive PE population is uncertain with regard to clinical decision-making. It is reasonable to hypothesize that delivering a lower overall thrombolytic agent dose via catheter could mitigate the risk of major bleeding complications (14Kuo W.T. Endovascular therapy for acute pulmonary embolism.J Vasc Interv Radiol. 2012; 23: 167-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a previous study on flow dynamics (15Schmitz-Rode T. Kilbinger M. G\u00fcnther R.W. Simulated flow pattern in massive pulmonary embolism: significance for selective intrapulmonary thrombolysis.Cardiovasc Intervent Radiol. 1998; 21: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a systemically administered drug makes little contact with an obstructing embolus, and most of the drug flows away from the obstructing clot (ie, Venturi effect) toward the open nontarget vessels. Pharmacologic CDT overrides the Venturi effect because a soft, flexible catheter with multiple side holes is directly inserted under image guidance into the thrombosed target vessel to provide direct intraclot drug infusion. A potential advantage with CDT is targeted drug delivery into the clot to achieve low-dose thrombolysis, which may reduce bleeding risk (14Kuo W.T. Endovascular therapy for acute pulmonary embolism.J Vasc Interv Radiol. 2012; 23: 167-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, relative to systemic drug therapy, local CDT may improve drug effectiveness, allow a lower drug dose to be used, and result in fewer bleeding complications. Despite some limitations of available evidence (12Kuo W.T. Gould M.K. Louie J.D. Rosenberg J.K. Sze D.Y. Hofmann L.V.

This largely reflects the imminent risk of death and the juxtaposition of a large degree of uncertainty with the estimates of safety and efficacy of CDT and surgical therapy versus the bleeding risk associated with systemic thrombolysis. However, the optimal treatment strategy for submassive PE is still evolving. The 2011 American Heart Association guidelines (2Jaff M.R. McMurtry M.S. Archer S.L. et al.Management of massive and submassive pulmonary embolism, iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis, and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association.Circulation. 2011; 123: 1788-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar) state that \u201c[systemic] Fibrinolysis may be considered for patients with submassive acute PE judged to have clinical evidence of adverse prognosis (new hemodynamic instability, worsening respiratory insufficiency, severe [right ventricular] RV dysfunction, or major myocardial necrosis) and low risk of bleeding complications\u2026 Either catheter embolectomy or surgical embolectomy may be considered for patients with submassive acute PE judged to have clinical evidence of adverse prognosis (new hemodynamic instability, worsening respiratory failure, severe RV dysfunction, or major myocardial necrosis).\u201d The 2014 European Society of Cardiology guidelines (9Konstantinides S.V.

Because systemic thrombolysis carries a significant risk of major hemorrhage, current guidelines have tempered the indication for use of systemic thrombolysis for intermediate-risk PE, suggesting that it be used only when there is cardiac enzyme leak and/or impending hemodynamic collapse (2Jaff M.R. McMurtry M.S. Archer S.L. et al.Management of massive and submassive pulmonary embolism, iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis, and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association.Circulation. 2011; 123: 1788-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar, 3Kearon C.

This causes a dilemma because patients with moderate to severe RV strain are still at risk of sudden cardiac collapse and death before the development of cardiac enzyme leak and impending life-threatening shock (5Goldhaber S.Z. Visani L. De Rosa M.

Other patients with submassive PE may have severe and persistent pulmonary symptoms (eg, severe hypoxia, tachypnea, and dyspnea on exertion) that is not relieved by therapeutic anticoagulation. In such scenarios, the availability of a treatment option with a more favorable risk-to-benefit profile than systemic thrombolysis would be optimal. It is possible that CDT meets this criterion; however, current estimates of the safety and efficacy of CDT are based on exceedingly limited data and therefore carry major uncertainty. For this reason, even though it is reasonable to target escalation of care to individual patient circumstances (especially for cases bordering on massive PE physiology that are associated with a low risk of bleeding), CDT cannot be firmly recommended for these patient groups at present. Further prospective studies are needed to address these issues, following the lead of three early prospective studies (16Kucher N. Boekstegers P.

The ULTIMA RCT (16Kucher N. Boekstegers P. M\u00fcller O.J. et al.Randomized, controlled trial of ultrasound-assisted catheter-directed thrombolysis for acute intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism.Circulation. 2014; 129: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar) enrolled 59 patients with submassive acute main or lower-lobe PE presenting within 14 days and an RV-to-left ventricle (LV) diameter ratio \u2265 1.0 on echocardiography. The study randomized patients to receive unfractionated heparin versus unfractionated heparin plus CDT with the use of an ultrasound (US)-assisted thrombolysis regimen and a maximum TPA dose of 10\u201320 mg over 15 hours. The ULTIMA trial showed that US-assisted CDT was superior to anticoagulation alone in reversing RV dilation at 24 hours, with no increase in bleeding complications. The trial was limited by selection of a small, idealized trial population, as 84% of screened patients were excluded and only 30 patients were enrolled in the treatment arm. The study was not designed to assess long-term outcomes of CDT and the risk of development of post-PE syndrome (PPS) or chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). The ULTIMA trial was also an industry-sponsored trial that did not compare US-assisted catheters versus standard CDT; therefore, the contribution of US was unclear. Nevertheless, the ULTIMA trial was the first RCT to test a standardized catheter intervention in patients with acute submassive PE and confirm that a low-dose CDT regimen is superior to anticoagulation alone in improving RV dilation at 24 hours (16Kucher N. Boekstegers P. M\u00fcller O.J. et al.Randomized, controlled trial of ultrasound-assisted catheter-directed thrombolysis for acute intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism.Circulation. 2014; 129: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). The SEATTLE II trial (17Piazza G. Hohlfelder B. Jaff M.R. et al.A prospective, single-arm, multicenter trial of ultrasound-facilitated catheter-directed low-dose fibrinolysis for acute massive and submassive pulmonary embolism (SEATTLE II).JACC Cardiovasc Interv. 2015; 8: 1382-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) (a prospective, single-arm, multicenter trial of ultrasound-facilitated, catheter-directed, low-dose fibrinolysis for acute massive and submassive pulmonary embolism) enrolled 119 patients with submassive PE and 31 patients with massive PE. Eligible patients had proven proximal PE and an RV:LV diameter ratio \u2265 0.9 confirmed on contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography (CT). The maximum dose of TPA was 24 mg infused via US-assisted catheter over 12\u201324 hours. During CDT, unfractionated heparin was infused at intermediate intensity (ie, subtherapeutic) with a target activated partial thromboplastin time of 40\u201360 seconds. The study concluded that low-dose CDT fibrinolysis improves RV function in acute PE, decreases angiographic pulmonary artery obstruction, and reduces systolic pulmonary artery pressure. There was an 11% major bleeding rate in the SEATTLE II trial (17Piazza G. Hohlfelder B. Jaff M.R. et al.A prospective, single-arm, multicenter trial of ultrasound-facilitated catheter-directed low-dose fibrinolysis for acute massive and submassive pulmonary embolism (SEATTLE II).JACC Cardiovasc Interv. 2015; 8: 1382-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar), which, despite the lack of catastrophic bleeding events, adds to the uncertainty concerning whether CDT is truly safer than systemic thrombolysis. In addition, the risk of major bleeding was associated with multiple venous access attempts (ie, access site complications) (19Sadiq I. Goldhaber S.Z. Liu P.Y. Piazza G. for the SEATTLE II investigatorsRisk factors for major bleeding in the SEATTLE II trial.Vasc Med. 2017; 22: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The trial (17Piazza G.

By approximately linking the features, a global projective transform should be generated for geometry registration by automatic methods, while automatic contrast correction should be non-parametric. This challenge is met only by one out of 36 published algorithms. Hence, although numerous computer-based techniques have been published, only a few of them are applied more than once in practice.The key code proposed in this paper is useful for technical classification of a posteriori registration methods in dental radiography and allows their objective comparison.

We propose that generation of diagnostic hypotheses in this context is the result of cognitive processes subserved by brain mechanisms that are similar to those involved in naming objects or concepts in everyday life. Methodology and Principal Findings To test this proposal we developed an experimental paradigm with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using radiological diagnosis as a model. Twenty-five radiologists diagnosed lesions in chest X-ray images and named non-medical targets (animals) embedded in chest X-ray images while being scanned in a fMRI session. Images were presented for 1.5 seconds; response times (RTs) and the ensuing cortical activations were assessed. The mean response time for diagnosing lesions was 1.33 (SD \u00b10.14) seconds and 1.23 (SD \u00b10.13) seconds for naming animals. 72% of the radiologists reported cogitating differential diagnoses during trials (3.5 seconds). The overall pattern of cortical activations was remarkably similar for both types of targets. However, within the neural systems shared by both stimuli, activation was significantly greater in left inferior frontal sulcus and posterior cingulate cortex for lesions relative to animals. Conclusions Generation of diagnostic hypotheses and differential diagnoses made through the immediate visual recognition of clinical signs can be a fast and automatic process. The co-localization of significant brain activation for lesions and animals suggests that generating diagnostic hypotheses for lesions and naming animals are served by the same neuronal systems. Nevertheless, diagnosing lesions was cognitively more demanding and associated with more activation in higher order cortical areas. These results support the hypothesis that medical diagnoses based on prompt visual recognition of clinical signs and naming in everyday life are supported by similar brain systems."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2073222767", "relevance_score": 289.42426, "publication_year": 2000, "title": "Overview of the radiology of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)", "cited_by_count": 40, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Oligoarthritis", "level": 4, "score": 0.96670127}, {"display_name": "Arthritis", "level": 2, "score": 0.8113116}, {"display_name": "Psoriatic arthritis", "level": 3, "score": 0.80159783}, {"display_name": "Enthesitis", "level": 4, "score": 0.744609}, {"display_name": "Differential diagnosis", "level": 2, "score": 0.57345563}, {"display_name": "Dermatology", "level": 1, "score": 0.5686848}, {"display_name": "Rheumatoid arthritis", "level": 2, "score": 0.4946625}, {"display_name": "Inflammatory arthritis", "level": 3, "score": 0.47520146}, {"display_name": "Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis", "level": 3, "score": 0.45658273}, {"display_name": "Rheumatoid factor", "level": 3, "score": 0.44819418}, {"display_name": "Stage (stratigraphy)", "level": 2, "score": 0.44646573}, {"display_name": "Internal medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.30623865}, {"display_name": "Pathology", "level": 1, "score": 0.22931081}, {"display_name": "Polyarthritis", "level": 3, "score": 0.21084628}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Plain": [0], "films": [1], "remain": [2], "the": [3, 21, 71], "basic": [4], "tool": [5], "for": [6], "diagnosis": [7], "and": [8, 47], "follow-up": [9], "evaluation": [10], "of": [11, 24, 56], "juvenile": [12], "idiopathic": [13], "arthritis": [14, 33, 38, 46], "(JIA).": [15], "In": [16], "this": [17], "paper,": [18], "we": [19], "review": [20, 53], "new": [22], "classification": [23], "JIA:": [25], "systemic": [26], "arthritis,": [27, 44], "oligoarthritis": [28, 30], "(persistent),": [29], "(extended),": [31], "polyarticular": [32, 37], "(rheumatoid": [34, 39], "factor": [35, 40], "negative),": [36], "positive),": [41], "enthesitis": [42], "related": [43], "psoriatic": [45], "unclassified": [48], "arthritis.": [49], "We": [50], "will": [51], "also": [52], "regional": [54], "abnormalities": [55], "three": [57], "stages:": [58], "an": [59, 62], "early": [60], "stage,": [61, 64, 67], "intermediate": [63], "a": [65], "late": [66], "as": [68, 70], "well": [69], "differential": [72], "diagnosis.": [73]}, "authors": ["P.

Only a few articles have described the status of the lumbar spine affected by RA based on plain X-ray films and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).To describe the features and prevalence of radiological changes of the lumbar spine of patients with RA and to clarify the correlations of such features with disease activity.Transverse radiological study.We radiographically examined 104 patients with RA whose age ranged from 21 to 78 years (mean, 51.0). In each, the duration of RA exceeded 10 years (mean, 17.7 years).Clinical outcomes included Ochi's classification, Lansbury index, C-reactive protein (CRP) (mg/dL), rheumatoid factor (RF) (U/mL), and platelet (count/mm). Radiological outcomes included radiography and MRI.One hundred four RA patients were included in this study regardless of the presence/absence of low back pain. We examined discs from L1-2 to L5-S, including endplates, in each patient on plain X-ray films and magnetic resonance images and used a comprehensive grading system to evaluate each feature of the lumbar spine affected by RA based on the present findings and published reports. The correlations of these radiological features with RA activity and Ochi's classification were examined. To quantify disease activity, we determined the Lansbury index, serum CRP (mg/dL), RF (U/mL), and platelet count (count/mm) at the time of radiological examinations.Of the 104 patients, 47 (45.2%) exhibited a lumbar lesion. There were two types of lumbar disc lesions related to RA: disc narrowing and disc ballooning. The Lansbury index of patients with the most severe lesions was significantly higher than that of patients with less severe lesions (p<.01). The frequency of lumbar involvement also increased as the number of affected peripheral joints increased, and Ochi's classification appeared to be useful in predicting the occurrence of lumbar lesions.Of 104 patients, 47 (45.2%) exhibited abnormalities on X-ray films and MRI. There were two types of disorders, disc narrowing and disc ballooning.

EDS patients were also evaluated for back pain by numeric pain rating scale (NRS- 11).Vertebral fractures were significantly more prevalent in EDS as compared to the control subjects (38.5% vs. 5.1%; p b 0.001) without significant differences in BMD at either skeletal sites. In EDS patients, the prevalence of vertebral fractures was not significantly (p = 0.72) different between classic and hypermobility types. BMD was not significantly different between fractured and non-fractured EDS patients either at lumbar spine (p = 0.14), total hip (p=0.08), or femoral neck (p=0.21). Severe back pain(\u22657 NRS)was more frequent in EDS patients with vertebral fractures as compared to thosewithout fractures (60% vs. 28%; p=0.04). Inconclusion, this is the first study showing high prevalence of vertebral fractures in a relatively large population of EDS patients. Vertebral fractures were associated with more severe back pain suggesting a potential involvement of skeletal fragility in determining poor quality of life.

Methods 83 patients with both benign and malignant liver lesions were examined using CEUS and MRI after the intravenous administration of liver-specific contrast media. All patients had inconclusive results from prior imaging examinations. Histopathological specimens could be obtained in 53 patients. Ultrasound was performed using a multi-frequency curved probe (1 \u2013 6 MHz) after the injection of 1 \u2013 2.4 ml ultrasound contrast media. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of CEUS, MRI and a combination of both (CEUS + MRI) were compared. Results The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values regarding lesion classification were 90.9 %, 70.6 %, 92.3 % and 66.6 %, respectively, for CEUS; 90.9 %, 82.4 %, 95.2 % and 70.0 %, respectively, for MRI; and 96.9 %, 70.6 %, 92.7 % and 85.7 % respectively, for CEUS + MRI. There were no statistically significant differences. 6 malignant lesions were missed using CEUS or MRI alone (false negatives). The use of both modalities combined reduced the false-negative results to 2. Conclusion CEUS and MRI with liver-specific contrast media are very reliable and of equal informative value in the characterization of focal liver lesions. The number of false-negative results can be decreased using a combination of the two methods."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2993784169", "relevance_score": 178.64871, "publication_year": 2020, "title": "Radiologic-Radiomic Machine Learning Models for Differentiation of Benign and Malignant Solid Renal Masses: Comparison With Expert-Level Radiologists", "cited_by_count": 40, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Renal cell carcinoma", "level": 2, "score": 0.6029503}, {"display_name": "Chromophobe cell", "level": 4, "score": 0.5943938}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.5798403}, {"display_name": "McNemar's test", "level": 2, "score": 0.56720775}, {"display_name": "Clear cell", "level": 3, "score": 0.4864833}, {"display_name": "Retrospective cohort study", "level": 2, "score": 0.41143948}, {"display_name": "Pathology", "level": 1, "score": 0.30367637}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"OBJECTIVE.": [0], "The": [1, 128], "objective": [2], "of": [3, 11, 22, 42, 100, 139, 147, 161, 169, 185, 193, 246, 254], "our": [4], "study": [5, 38], "was": [6], "to": [7, 284], "compare": [8], "the": [9, 114, 124, 132, 213, 218], "performance": [10, 129, 220, 268], "radiologicradiomic": [12, 89], "machine": [13, 94], "learning": [14], "(ML)": [15], "models": [16, 97, 120], "and": [17, 24, 57, 65, 82, 105, 117, 145, 158, 167, 177, 183, 191, 198, 203, 227, 233, 235, 237, 242, 249, 251, 257, 288], "expert-level": [18, 76, 115], "radiologists": [19, 77, 116, 134, 262], "for": [20, 88, 98, 113, 131, 153, 171, 195, 222, 269], "differentiation": [21], "benign": [23, 271], "malignant": [25, 273], "solid": [26, 274], "renal": [27, 44, 101, 275], "masses": [28, 102], "using": [29, 107, 123], "contrast-enhanced": [30], "CT": [31, 70, 81], "examinations.": [32, 71], "MATERIALS": [33], "AND": [34], "METHODS.": [35], "This": [36], "retrospective": [37], "included": [39], "a": [40, 108, 210, 244, 252, 281], "cohort": [41], "254": [43], "cell": [45, 50], "carcinomas": [46], "(RCCs)": [47], "(190": [48], "clear": [49], "RCCs": [51, 55, 60], "[ccRCCs],": [52], "38": [53], "chromophobe": [54], "[chrRCCs],": [56], "26": [58, 62], "papillary": [59], "[pRCCs]),": [61], "fat-poor": [63, 175, 201, 231, 240], "angioleiomyolipomas,": [64], "10": [66], "oncocytomas": [67, 178, 204], "with": [68], "preoperative": [69], "Lesions": [72], "identified": [73], "by": [74], "four": [75, 133], "(>": [78], "3000": [79], "genitourinary": [80], "MRI": [83], "studies)": [84], "were": [85, 103, 121, 135], "manually": [86], "segmented": [87], "analysis.": [90], "Disease-specific": [91], "support": [92], "vector": [93], "radiologic-radiomic": [95, 118, 214], "ML": [96, 119, 215, 278], "classification": [99], "trained": [104], "validated": [106], "10-fold": [109, 211], "cross-validation.": [110], "Performance": [111], "values": [112, 130, 221], "compared": [122], "McNemar": [125], "test.": [126], "RESULTS.": [127], "as": [136], "follows:": [137], "sensitivity": [138, 160, 184, 245], "73.7-96.8%": [140, 162], "(median,": [141, 149, 163, 179, 187, 205], "84.5%;": [142, 164, 188], "variance,": [143, 151, 165, 181, 189, 207], "122.7%)": [144, 166, 190], "specificity": [146, 168, 192, 253], "48.4-71.9%": [148], "61.8%;": [150], "161.6%)": [152], "differentiating": [154, 172, 196, 223, 270], "ccRCCs": [155, 173, 224, 229], "from": [156, 174, 200, 225, 230, 239, 272], "pRCCs": [157, 197, 226, 236], "chrRCCs;": [159], "52.8-88.9%": [170], "angioleiomyolipomas": [176, 202, 232, 241], "80.6%;": [180], "269.1%);": [182], "28.1-60.9%": [186], "75.0-88.9%": [194], "chrRCCs": [199, 238], "50.0%;": [206], "191.1%).": [208], "After": [209], "cross-validation,": [212], "model": [216], "yielded": [217], "following": [219], "chrRCCs,": [228], "oncocytomas,": [234], "oncocytomas:": [243], "90.0%,": [247], "86.3%,": [248], "73.4%": [250], "89.1%,": [255], "83.3%,": [256], "91.7%,": [258], "respectively.": [259], "CONCLUSION.": [260], "Expert-level": [261], "had": [263], "obviously": [264], "large": [265], "variances": [266], "in": [267], "masses.": [276], "Radiologic-radiomic": [277], "can": [279], "be": [280], "potential": [282], "way": [283], "improve": [285], "interreader": [286], "concordance": [287], "performance.": [289]}, "authors": ["Xueying Sun", "Qi Sheng Feng", "Xun Xu", "Jing Zhang", "Feipeng Zhu", "Yan-Hao Yang", "Yudong Zhang"], "abstract": "OBJECTIVE. The objective of our study was to compare the performance of radiologicradiomic machine learning (ML) models and expert-level radiologists for differentiation of benign and malignant solid renal masses using contrast-enhanced CT examinations. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This retrospective study included a cohort of 254 renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) (190 clear cell RCCs [ccRCCs], 38 chromophobe RCCs [chrRCCs], and 26 papillary RCCs [pRCCs]), 26 fat-poor angioleiomyolipomas, and 10 oncocytomas with preoperative CT examinations. Lesions identified by four expert-level radiologists (> 3000 genitourinary CT and MRI studies) were manually segmented for radiologicradiomic analysis. Disease-specific support vector machine radiologic-radiomic ML models for classification of renal masses were trained and validated using a 10-fold cross-validation. Performance values for the expert-level radiologists and radiologic-radiomic ML models were compared using the McNemar test. RESULTS. The performance values for the four radiologists were as follows: sensitivity of 73.7-96.8% (median, 84.5%; variance, 122.7%) and specificity of 48.4-71.9% (median, 61.8%; variance, 161.6%) for differentiating ccRCCs from pRCCs and chrRCCs; sensitivity of 73.7-96.8% (median, 84.5%; variance, 122.7%) and specificity of 52.8-88.9% for differentiating ccRCCs from fat-poor angioleiomyolipomas and oncocytomas (median, 80.6%; variance, 269.1%); and sensitivity of 28.1-60.9% (median, 84.5%; variance, 122.7%) and specificity of 75.0-88.9% for differentiating pRCCs and chrRCCs from fat-poor angioleiomyolipomas and oncocytomas (median, 50.0%; variance, 191.1%). After a 10-fold cross-validation, the radiologic-radiomic ML model yielded the following performance values for differentiating ccRCCs from pRCCs and chrRCCs, ccRCCs from fat-poor angioleiomyolipomas and oncocytomas, and pRCCs and chrRCCs from fat-poor angioleiomyolipomas and oncocytomas: a sensitivity of 90.0%, 86.3%, and 73.4% and a specificity of 89.1%, 83.3%, and 91.7%, respectively. CONCLUSION. Expert-level radiologists had obviously large variances in performance for differentiating benign from malignant solid renal masses. Radiologic-radiomic ML can be a potential way to improve interreader concordance and performance."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2033298558", "relevance_score": 314.5357, "publication_year": 1998, "title": "The role of radiology in children with anorectal anomalies;", "cited_by_count": 39, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Anorectal anomalies", "level": 2, "score": 0.77715504}, {"display_name": "Radiological weapon", "level": 2, "score": 0.7372483}, {"display_name": "Rectum", "level": 2, "score": 0.69152546}, {"display_name": "Imperforate anus", "level": 2, "score": 0.53635204}, {"display_name": "Pelvic floor", "level": 2, "score": 0.48989028}, {"display_name": "Lesion", "level": 2, "score": 0.47991022}, {"display_name": "Sagittal plane", "level": 2, "score": 0.4738056}, {"display_name": "Congenital malformations", "level": 3, "score": 0.45659766}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.45233133}, {"display_name": "Surgery", "level": 1, "score": 0.44130147}, {"display_name": "Anatomy", "level": 1, "score": 0.35036126}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Anorectal": [0], "anomalies": [1, 118], "have": [2, 119], "a": [3, 59, 73, 127], "reported": [4], "incidence": [5], "of": [6, 35, 66, 113, 129, 141, 157, 162, 198], "between": [7], "1": [8, 12], "per": [9, 13], "1000": [10], "and": [11, 27, 70, 99, 145, 174, 192], "9630": [14], "live": [15], "births.": [16], "The": [17, 38, 137, 154], "international": [18], "classification": [19, 39, 80], "subdivides": [20], "anorectal": [21, 117, 199], "malformations": [22, 200], "into": [23], "high,": [24, 97], "intermediate,": [25, 69], "low": [26, 74, 100], "miscellaneous": [28], "deformities": [29], "with": [30, 107, 116, 180], "emphasis": [31], "on": [32, 42, 88], "the": [33, 36, 44, 50, 55, 64, 67, 142, 160, 163, 175, 188, 196, 205], "sex": [34], "child.": [37], "is": [40, 57, 72], "based": [41, 87], "where": [43], "rectum": [45], "terminates": [46], "in": [47, 148, 159, 195], "relation": [48], "to": [49, 103, 169, 187], "levator": [51, 56, 68], "ani": [52], "muscles": [53], "above": [54], "termed": [58], "high": [60], "(supralevator)": [61], "lesion,": [62], "at": [63], "level": [65], "below": [71], "or": [75, 166], "translevator": [76], "anomaly.": [77], "A": [78], "modified": [79], "has": [81], "recently": [82], "been": [83], "proposed": [84], "by": [85], "Pena": [86], "his": [89], "anatomic": [90], "observations": [91], "during": [92], "posterior": [93], "sagittal": [94], "anorectoplasty-the": [95], "terms": [96], "intermediate": [98], "lesions": [101, 125], "continue": [102], "be": [104, 134, 152, 184, 202], "used": [105], "but": [106], "slightly": [108], "different": [109], "connotations.": [110], "Approximately": [111], "50%": [112], "all": [114], "patients": [115], "associated": [120], "other": [121, 189], "congenital": [122], "lesions.": [123], "These": [124], "necessitate": [126], "variety": [128], "radiological": [130, 190], "investigations": [131], "which": [132], "will": [133, 151, 183, 201], "outlined": [135], "briefly.": [136], "pertinent": [138], "muscular": [139], "anatomy": [140], "pelvic": [143], "floor": [144], "recent": [146], "advances": [147], "surgical": [149], "techniques": [150], "discussed.": [153], "particular": [155], "role": [156], "MRI": [158], "evaluation": [161, 197], "pre-operative": [164], "newborn": [165], "infant": [167], "prior": [168], "definitive": [170], "pull-through": [171], "repair": [172], "surgery": [173], "post-operative,": [176], "older,": [177], "paediatric": [178], "patient": [179], "continuing": [181], "problems": [182], "reviewed.": [185], "Reference": [186], "options,": [191], "their": [193], "usefulness,": [194], "made": [203], "throughout": [204], "text.": [206]}, "authors": ["Kieran McHugh"], "abstract": "Anorectal anomalies have a reported incidence of between 1 per 1000 and 1 per 9630 live births.

The classification is based on where the rectum terminates in relation to the levator ani muscles above the levator is termed a high (supralevator) lesion, at the level of the levator intermediate, and below is a low or translevator anomaly.

Rapid identification of COVID-19 and its severity in individual patients is expected to enable better control of the disease individually and at-large. There has been remarkable interest by the scientific community in using imaging biomarkers to improve detection and management of COVID-19. Exploratory tools such as AI-based models may help explain the complex biological mechanisms and provide better understanding of the underlying pathophysiological processes. The present review focuses on AI-based COVID-19 studies as applies to chest x-ray (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) imaging modalities, and the associated challenges. Explicit radiomics, deep learning methods, and hybrid methods that combine both deep learning and explicit radiomics have the potential to enhance the ability and usefulness of radiological images to assist clinicians in the current COVID-19 pandemic. The aims of this review are: first, to outline COVID-19 AI-analysis workflows, including acquisition of data, feature selection, segmentation methods, feature extraction, and multi-variate model development and validation as appropriate for AI-based COVID-19 studies. Secondly, existing limitations of AI-based COVID-19 analyses are discussed, highlighting potential improvements that can be made. Finally, the impact of AI and radiomics methods and the associated clinical outcomes are summarized. In this review, pipelines that include the key steps for AI-based COVID-19 signatures identification are elaborated. Sample size, non-standard imaging protocols, segmentation, availability of public COVID-19 databases, combination of imaging and clinical information and full clinical validation remain major limitations and challenges. We conclude that AI-based assessment of CXR and CT images has significant potential as a viable pathway for the diagnosis, follow-up and prognosis of COVID-19."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2051594991", "relevance_score": 265.71985, "publication_year": 2013, "title": "Exposure to, Understanding of, and Interest in Interventional Radiology in American Medical Students", "cited_by_count": 39, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Accreditation", "level": 2, "score": 0.70640093}, {"display_name": "Medical education", "level": 1, "score": 0.5850657}, {"display_name": "Medical school", "level": 2, "score": 0.5481199}, {"display_name": "Family medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.3988253}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"The": [0], "purposes": [1], "of": [2, 27, 62, 94, 106, 126, 135, 182, 192], "this": [3], "study": [4, 188], "were": [5, 98, 119, 137], "to": [6, 10, 16, 23, 31, 60, 73, 78, 89, 132, 154], "determine": [7], "the": [8, 28, 48, 75, 90, 127, 145, 167, 187, 193], "degree": [9], "which": [11], "medical": [12, 21, 63, 83, 159, 172], "students": [13, 84, 95, 107, 146, 173], "are": [14], "exposed": [15], "interventional": [17], "radiology": [18, 66], "(IR)": [19], "in": [20, 35, 100, 112, 121, 150, 156, 166, 177], "school,": [22], "assess": [24, 133], "their": [25, 33, 79], "knowledge": [26], "field,": [29], "and": [30, 65, 70, 116, 195], "gauge": [32], "interest": [34, 165, 176], "IR": [36, 114, 128, 136, 152, 155, 183], "as": [37], "a": [38, 101], "career": [39], "choice.An": [40], "institutional": [41], "review": [42], "board-approved": [43], "survey": [44, 76], "was": [45, 55], "generated": [46], "using": [47], "website": [49], "www.surveymonkey.com.": [50], "Medical": [51], "student": [52], "participation": [53], "nationwide": [54], "elicited": [56], "by": [57], "sending": [58], "e-mails": [59], "administrators": [61], "schools": [64], "residency": [67], "program": [68], "directors": [69], "asking": [71], "them": [72], "distribute": [74], "link": [77], "students.Seven": [80], "hundred": [81], "twenty-nine": [82], "from": [85, 199], "21": [86], "states": [87], "responded": [88], "survey.": [91], "Although": [92], "58%": [93], "said": [96, 108], "they": [97, 109], "interested": [99, 120], "hands-on": [102, 179], "career,": [103], "only": [104, 117], "5.5%": [105], "had": [110, 148], "participated": [111, 149], "an": [113, 151], "rotation": [115], "12.7%": [118], "IR.": [122], "Less": [123], "than": [124], "half": [125], "domain-related": [129], "questions": [130], "used": [131], "understanding": [134, 142, 191], "answered": [138], "correctly,": [139], "with": [140, 175], "greater": [141, 200], "found": [143], "among": [144, 171, 186], "who": [147], "rotation.Exposure": [153], "accredited": [157], "US": [158], "education": [160], "programs": [161], "is": [162, 169, 184], "inconsistent,": [163], "although": [164], "field": [168, 194], "moderate": [170], "compared": [174], "other": [178], "specialties.": [180], "Understanding": [181], "limited": [185], "population.": [189], "Improved": [190], "recruitment": [196], "could": [197], "result": [198], "exposure.": [201]}, "authors": ["Lavi Nissim", "Elizabeth A.

Medical student participation nationwide was elicited by sending e-mails to administrators of medical schools and radiology residency program directors and asking them to distribute the survey link to their students.Seven hundred twenty-nine medical students from 21 states responded to the survey. Although 58% of students said they were interested in a hands-on career, only 5.5% of students said they had participated in an IR rotation and only 12.7% were interested in IR. Less than half of the IR domain-related questions used to assess understanding of IR were answered correctly, with greater understanding found among the students who had participated in an IR rotation.Exposure to IR in accredited US medical education programs is inconsistent, although interest in the field is moderate among medical students compared with interest in other hands-on specialties.

IIPs include a subset of diffuse and restrictive lung diseases, resulting from damage to the parenchyma characterised by inflammation and fibrosis of the interstitium. Classification into major and rare IIPs is based on the 2013 ATS/ERS committee. The diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) needs to exclude other well-known causes of interstitial lung diseases. According to the 2011 evidence-based guidelines, usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) can be diagnosed by HRCT when all criteria are fulfilled. Non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) is characterised by patchy ground-glass opacities and irregular linear/reticular opacities. The imaging patterns of respiratory bronchiolitis associated-interstitial lung disease (RB-ILD) and desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP) show centrolobular nodules and ground-glass opacities. Cryptogenic organising pneumonia (COP) consists of patchy peripheral or peribronchial consolidations, while ground-glass opacities are typically associated with diffuse lung consolidation, evolving to fibrosis, in acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP). Rare IIPs include lymphoid interstitial pneumonia and idiopathic pleuro-parenchymal fibroelastosis (IPPFE). The knowledge of IIP imaging features on HRCT images help radiologists in diagnosis. Moreover, the overlap of imaging features needs a multidisciplinary approach. \u2022 UIP findings are reticulations, bronchiectasis, honeycombing and absence of inconsistent features. \u2022 Bilateral patchy ground-glass areas represent the most encountered features in NSIP. \u2022 Poorly defined centrilobular nodules are typical of RB-ILD, whereas a ground-glass appearance is typical of DIP. \u2022 HRCT features of COP include characteristic peripheral or peribronchial patchy consolidations. \u2022 Rare IIPs include idiopathic LIP and idiopathic pleuro-parenchymal fibroelastosis (PPFE)."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2060075944", "relevance_score": 250.78069, "publication_year": 2000, "title": "Methods for imaging the structure and function of living tissues and cells: 3.

Data obtained from preoperative cervical spine magnetic resonance (MR) imaging studies were each analyzed on two separate occasions by two blinded radiologists. The parameters determined were signal change and the presence and severity of compression. Clinical outcome was determined by pre- and postoperative timed walks, as well as by evaluation of myelopathy disability index scores, Ranawat classification, and Nurick grades. There was good inter- and intraobserver reliability for determination of radiological data. A significant relationship was found between MR imaging signal change and surgery-related outcome, as reflected by improvement in walking parameters; however, this was confounded by the fact that signal change also related to preoperative walking parameters, and those patients for whom preoperative walking function was worse experienced greater functional improvement in walking postoperatively. The relationships between ambulatory-related data and severity or extent of spinal cord compression were less marked.Cervical cord compression and intrinsic MR imaging signal change correlate with clinical severity, and, in this population, the presence of signal change was correlated with better surgery-related outcome. However, confounding factors and the lack of strong correlation indicate that these radiological measurements are insufficient to be used as a reliable tool for predicting surgery-related benefits in individual patients."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2023267564", "relevance_score": 232.78912, "publication_year": 1989, "title": "Comparison of performance characteristics of conventional and K-edge filters in general diagnostic radiology", "cited_by_count": 39, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Fluoroscopy", "level": 2, "score": 0.6431218}, {"display_name": "Filtration (mathematics)", "level": 2, "score": 0.6381632}, {"display_name": "Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution", "level": 2, "score": 0.6073739}, {"display_name": "Filter (signal processing)", "level": 2, "score": 0.5169472}, {"display_name": "Radiation dose", "level": 2, "score": 0.5148148}, {"display_name": "Contrast (vision)", "level": 2, "score": 0.46016783}, {"display_name": "Edge enhancement", "level": 4, "score": 0.45658463}, {"display_name": "Field (mathematics)", "level": 2, "score": 0.41445813}, {"display_name": "Medical physics", "level": 1, "score": 0.40792108}, {"display_name": "Nuclear medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.36193258}, {"display_name": "Image enhancement", "level": 3, "score": 0.32861403}, {"display_name": "Image (mathematics)", "level": 2, "score": 0.30484825}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.30181265}, {"display_name": "Artificial intelligence", "level": 1, "score": 0.26121315}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"The": [0, 19, 68, 76, 103], "performance": [1], "characteristics": [2], "of": [3, 15, 21, 65, 71, 79, 93, 127, 129], "conventional": [4, 43, 72], "and": [5, 31, 85, 90], "K-edge": [6, 56], "filters": [7, 44, 57, 73], "have": [8], "been": [9, 112], "studied": [10], "for": [11, 61, 82, 95, 105], "the": [12, 23, 62, 91, 119], "entire": [13], "field": [14], "general": [16], "diagnostic": [17], "radiology.": [18], "problem": [20], "optimising": [22], "conflicting": [24], "needs": [25], "from": [26], "patient": [27], "dose,": [28], "image": [29], "contrast": [30], "exposure": [32], "time": [33], "was": [34], "managed": [35], "primarily": [36], "by": [37, 108], "computer": [38], "simulation.": [39], "In": [40], "comparison": [41], "to": [42, 114], "like": [45], "iron": [46], "or": [47], "copper": [48], "no": [49], "significant": [50], "advantages": [51], "can": [52], "be": [53, 115], "obtained": [54], "with": [55], "in": [58], "practice": [59], "except": [60], "special": [63], "circumstances": [64], "automatic": [66], "fluoroscopy.": [67], "optimal": [69], "choice": [70], "is": [74, 101], "discussed.": [75], "different": [77], "roles": [78], "backscattered": [80], "radiation": [81], "skin": [83], "dose": [84, 87, 106], "integral": [86], "are": [88, 132], "demonstrated,": [89], "necessity": [92], "correcting": [94], "increased": [96], "backscatter": [97], "following": [98], "additional": [99], "filtration": [100, 110], "stressed.": [102], "potential": [104], "reductions": [107], "adding": [109], "has": [111], "found": [113], "substantially": [116], "smaller": [117], "than": [118], "figures": [120], "mostly": [121], "reported.": [122], "Finally": [123], "some": [124], "methodological": [125], "problems": [126], "studies": [128], "this": [130], "kind": [131], "pointed": [133], "out.": [134]}, "authors": ["H.

The NLP system was trained and tested on expert-classified knee MRI reports from two major health care organizations. Radiology reports were modeled in the training set as vectors, and a support vector machine framework was used to train the classifier. A separate test set from each organization was used to evaluate the performance of the system. We evaluated the performance of the system both within and across organizations. Standard evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score (i.e., the weighted average of the precision and recall), and their respective 95% CIs were used to measure the efficacy of our classification system.The accuracy for radiology reports that belonged to the model's clinically significant concept classes after training data from the same institution was good, yielding an F1 score greater than 90% (95% CI, 84.6-97.3%). Performance of the classifier on cross-institutional application without institution-specific training data yielded F1 scores of 77.6% (95% CI, 69.5-85.7%) and 90.2% (95% CI, 84.5-95.9%) at the two organizations studied.The results show excellent accuracy by the NLP machine learning classifier in classifying free-text knee MRI reports, supporting the institution-independent reproducibility of knee MRI report classification. Furthermore, the machine learning classifier performed well on free-text knee MRI reports from another institution. These data support the feasibility of multiinstitutional classification of radiologic imaging text reports with a single machine learning classifier without requiring institution-specific training data."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2125425119", "relevance_score": 223.74962, "publication_year": 2013, "title": "The intra- and inter-rater reliability of X-ray radiological measurements for patellar instability", "cited_by_count": 39, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Radiological weapon", "level": 2, "score": 0.8012452}, {"display_name": "Reliability (semiconductor)", "level": 3, "score": 0.6249422}, {"display_name": "Radiography", "level": 2, "score": 0.54483664}, {"display_name": "Inter-rater reliability", "level": 3, "score": 0.49801707}, {"display_name": "Displacement (psychology)", "level": 2, "score": 0.47352695}, {"display_name": "Orthodontics", "level": 1, "score": 0.46298897}, {"display_name": "Limits of agreement", "level": 2, "score": 0.4213658}, {"display_name": "Physical therapy", "level": 1, "score": 0.35274684}, {"display_name": "Nuclear medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.27269304}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Patellar": [0], "instability": [1], "is": [2, 9], "a": [3, 59, 62, 101, 153], "complex,": [4], "multi-factorial": [5], "disorder.": [6], "Radiological": [7, 69], "assessment": [8], "regarded": [10], "as": [11], "an": [12, 66], "important": [13], "part": [14], "of": [15, 18, 23, 34, 107, 159, 174, 183, 230], "the": [16, 29, 105, 147, 184, 190, 228, 241], "management": [17], "this": [19, 24], "population.": [20], "The": [21, 127], "purpose": [22], "study": [25], "was": [26, 115], "to": [27, 39, 121, 188, 204, 211, 221], "determine": [28], "intra-": [30, 123], "and": [31, 45, 65, 92, 124, 142, 168], "inter-rater": [32, 125, 148, 214, 242], "reliability": [33, 136, 149, 200], "common": [35], "radiological": [36, 60, 231], "measurements": [37, 70, 178, 186], "used": [38, 187], "evaluate": [40], "patellar": [41, 73, 83, 93, 160, 163, 166], "instability.": [42], "One": [43], "hundred": [44], "fifty": [46], "X-rays": [47], "from": [48], "51": [49], "individuals": [50], "were": [51, 98, 119, 236], "reviewed": [52], "by": [53], "five": [54], "reviewers,": [55], "two": [56], "orthopaedic": [57, 67], "trainees,": [58], "trainee,": [61], "consultant": [63], "radiologist": [64], "physiotherapist.": [68], "assessed": [71], "included": [72], "shape,": [74], "sulcus": [75], "angle,": [76, 78, 81, 164], "congruence": [77], "lateral": [79, 82, 86, 165, 169], "patellofemoral": [80, 191], "displacement": [84, 87], "(LPD),": [85], "measurement": [88, 132, 232], "(LDM),": [89], "boss": [90, 143], "height,": [91], "height": [94, 144, 161], "ratios.": [95], "All": [96], "assessors": [97, 151], "provided": [99], "with": [100], "summary": [102], "document": [103], "outlining": [104], "method": [106], "assessing": [108], "each": [109], "measurement.": [110], "No": [111], "further": [112], "formal": [113, 225], "teaching": [114], "provided.": [116], "Bland\u2013Altman": [117], "analyses": [118], "adopted": [120], "assess": [122, 189], "reliability.": [126, 243], "results": [128], "indicated": [129, 152, 179], "generally": [130], "low": [131, 154], "error": [133], "on": [134, 193], "intra-rater": [135], "assessment,": [137], "particularly": [138], "for": [139, 157, 176, 233], "LPD,": [140], "LDM": [141], "measurements.": [145], "Whilst": [146], "between": [150], "mean": [155], "difference": [156], "assessments": [158], "measurements,": [162], "dislocation": [167], "displacement,": [170], "wide": [171], "95%": [172], "limits": [173], "agreement": [175], "all": [177], "poor": [180, 197], "precision.": [181, 198], "Many": [182], "standard": [185], "joint": [192], "plain": [194], "radiographs": [195], "have": [196, 239], "Intra-rater": [199], "may": [201, 218], "be": [202, 219], "related": [203], "experience": [205], "but": [206], "it": [207], "seems": [208], "likely": [209], "that": [210], "achieve": [212], "good": [213], "reliability,": [215], "specific": [216], "training": [217, 226], "required": [220], "calibrate": [222], "observers.": [223], "More": [224], "in": [227], "technique": [229], "those": [234], "who": [235], "inexperienced": [237], "might": [238], "improved": [240]}, "authors": ["Toby Smith", "A.

The purpose of this study was to determine the intra- and inter-rater reliability of common radiological measurements used to evaluate patellar instability. One hundred and fifty X-rays from 51 individuals were reviewed by five reviewers, two orthopaedic trainees, a radiological trainee, a consultant radiologist and an orthopaedic physiotherapist. Radiological measurements assessed included patellar shape, sulcus angle, congruence angle, lateral patellofemoral angle, lateral patellar displacement (LPD), lateral displacement measurement (LDM), boss height, and patellar height ratios. All assessors were provided with a summary document outlining the method of assessing each measurement. No further formal teaching was provided. Bland\u2013Altman analyses were adopted to assess intra- and inter-rater reliability. The results indicated generally low measurement error on intra-rater reliability assessment, particularly for LPD, LDM and boss height measurements. Whilst the inter-rater reliability between assessors indicated a low mean difference for assessments of patellar height measurements, patellar angle, lateral patellar dislocation and lateral displacement, wide 95% limits of agreement for all measurements indicated poor precision. Many of the standard measurements used to assess the patellofemoral joint on plain radiographs have poor precision. Intra-rater reliability may be related to experience but it seems likely that to achieve good inter-rater reliability, specific training may be required to calibrate observers. More formal training in the technique of radiological measurement for those who were inexperienced might have improved the inter-rater reliability."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2074856198", "relevance_score": 222.33371, "publication_year": 2011, "title": "Characterizing Hospital Workers' Willingness to Respond to a Radiological Event", "cited_by_count": 39, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Radiological weapon", "level": 2, "score": 0.6560521}, {"display_name": "Perception", "level": 2, "score": 0.500087}, {"display_name": "Medical emergency", "level": 1, "score": 0.43906656}, {"display_name": "Triage", "level": 2, "score": 0.4339754}, {"display_name": "Government (linguistics)", "level": 2, "score": 0.41513363}, {"display_name": "Terrorism", "level": 2, "score": 0.41357338}, {"display_name": "Family medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.38919485}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Introduction": [0], "Terrorist": [1], "use": [2], "of": [3, 27, 48, 75, 88, 109, 137, 217, 224, 237], "a": [4, 14, 61, 81, 86, 94, 146, 184, 199, 210, 222, 232, 291], "radiological": [5, 19], "dispersal": [6], "device": [7, 17], "(RDD,": [8], "or": [9], "\u201cdirty": [10], "bomb\u201d),": [11], "which": [12], "combines": [13], "conventional": [15], "explosive": [16], "with": [18, 85, 221], "materials,": [20], "is": [21, 37, 52], "among": [22, 246, 256], "the": [23, 28, 55, 73, 110, 218, 257], "National": [24], "Planning": [25], "Scenarios": [26], "United": [29], "States": [30], "government.": [31], "Understanding": [32], "employee": [33], "willingness": [34, 57, 74, 228, 243], "to": [35, 58, 60, 71, 78, 80, 105, 116, 132, 143, 145, 154, 168, 170, 181, 194, 196, 207, 229, 231, 244, 269, 274, 285, 290], "respond": [36, 59, 79, 144, 208, 230, 245], "critical": [38], "for": [39], "planning": [40], "experts.": [41], "Previous": [42], "research": [43], "has": [44], "demonstrated": [45], "that": [46], "perception": [47, 223], "threat": [49, 238], "and": [50], "efficacy": [51, 226], "key": [53], "in": [54, 97, 198], "assessing": [56], "RDD": [62, 82, 147, 185, 200, 211, 234, 292], "event.": [63, 83, 235, 293], "Methods": [64], "An": [65], "anonymous": [66], "online": [67, 104], "survey": [68, 101], "was": [69, 91, 102, 130], "used": [70], "evaluate": [72], "hospital": [76, 134, 138, 219, 247, 271, 288], "employees": [77, 108, 125, 220, 272], "Agreement": [84], "series": [87], "belief": [89], "statements": [90], "assessed,": [92], "following": [93], "methodology": [95], "validated": [96], "previous": [98], "work.": [99], "The": [100], "available": [103], "all": [106], "18,612": [107], "Johns": [111], "Hopkins": [112], "Hospital": [113], "from": [114], "January": [115], "March": [117], "2009.": [118], "Results": [119], "Surveys": [120], "were": [121, 140, 160, 166, 176, 202], "completed": [122], "by": [123], "3426": [124], "(18.4%),": [126], "whose": [127], "demographic": [128], "distribution": [129], "similar": [131], "overall": [133], "staff.": [135], "39%": [136], "workers": [139], "not": [141, 152], "willing": [142, 161], "scenario": [148], "if": [149, 162, 213], "asked": [150], "but": [151], "required": [153, 175], "do": [155], "so.": [156], "Only": [157, 215], "11%": [158], "more": [159, 205], "required.": [163], "Workers": [164], "who": [165, 188], "hesitant": [167], "agree": [169], "work": [171, 197], "additional": [172], "hours": [173], "when": [174], "20": [177], "times": [178, 204], "less": [179], "likely": [180, 193, 206], "report": [182, 195], "during": [183, 209], "emergency.": [186], "Respondents": [187], "perceived": [189], "their": [190], "peers": [191], "as": [192, 253], "emergency": [201, 260], "17": [203], "event": [212], "asked.": [214], "27.9%": [216], "low": [225], "declared": [227], "severe": [233], "Perception": [236], "had": [239], "little": [240], "impact": [241], "on": [242], "workers.": [248], "Conclusions": [249], "Radiological": [250], "scenarios": [251], "such": [252], "RDDs": [254], "are": [255], "most": [258], "dreaded": [259], "events": [261], "yet": [262], "studied.": [263], "Several": [264], "attitudinal": [265], "indicators": [266], "can": [267], "help": [268], "identify": [270], "unlikely": [273], "respond.": [275], "These": [276], "risk-perception": [277], "modifiers": [278], "must": [279], "then": [280], "be": [281], "addressed": [282], "through": [283], "training": [284], "enable": [286], "effective": [287], "response": [289]}, "authors": ["Ran D.

Understanding employee willingness to respond is critical for planning experts. Previous research has demonstrated that perception of threat and efficacy is key in the assessing willingness to respond to a RDD event. Methods An anonymous online survey was used to evaluate the willingness of hospital employees to respond to a RDD event. Agreement with a series of belief statements was assessed, following a methodology validated in previous work. The survey was available online to all 18,612 employees of the Johns Hopkins Hospital from January to March 2009. Results Surveys were completed by 3426 employees (18.4%), whose demographic distribution was similar to overall hospital staff. 39% of hospital workers were not willing to respond to a RDD scenario if asked but not required to do so. Only 11% more were willing if required. Workers who were hesitant to agree to work additional hours when required were 20 times less likely to report during a RDD emergency. Respondents who perceived their peers as likely to report to work in a RDD emergency were 17 times more likely to respond during a RDD event if asked. Only 27.9% of the hospital employees with a perception of low efficacy declared willingness to respond to a severe RDD event. Perception of threat had little impact on willingness to respond among hospital workers. Conclusions Radiological scenarios such as RDDs are among the most dreaded emergency events yet studied. Several attitudinal indicators can help to identify hospital employees unlikely to respond.

Clinical and radiologic findings of patients with lumbar spinal stenosis and lumbar disc herniation presenting with neuropathic bladder were prospectively analyzed. Objectives. To study the relationship between the degree of cauda equina compression and prevalence of neuropathic bladder in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis and lumbar disc herniation. Summary of Background Data. Bladder dysfunction has frequently been noted in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis and lumbar disc herniation. However, there have been few studies that have demonstrated the correlation between bladder function and the degree of stenotic compression of the cauda equina seen on radiologic findings in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis and lumbar disc herniation. Methods. Thirty-four patients admitted for treatment for lumbar spinal stenosis or lumbar disc herniation underwent urodynamic studies, and computed tomographic scans after myelography were obtained to determine the degree of cauda equina compression. The cross-sectional area and anteroposterior diameter of the dural sac were measured at their smallest transverse area. Results. Twenty (58.8%) of the 34 patients were diagnosed with positive neuropathic bladder. There was no significant difference in the cross-sectional area of dural sac between the patients with positive neuropathic bladder and with negative neuropathic bladder. However, the dural sac anteroposterior diameter in positive neuropathic bladder patients was significantly shorter than that in patients with negative neuropathic bladder. A critical size for the dural sac of patients with neuropathic bladder was revealed as 8 mm in this study. Conclusions. The prevalence of neuropathic bladder is more significantly associated with dural sac anteroposterior diameter than with the cross-sectional area of dural sac. Therefore, dural sac anteroposterior diameter might be an important factor predicting the existence of neuropathic bladder. Bladder dysfunction is noted in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis and disc herniation. The prevalence of neuropathic bladder is more significantly associated with the anteroposte-rior diameter than with the cross-sectional area of dural sac. The dural sac anteroposterior diameter might be an important factor predicting the existence of neuropathic bladder."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W1964300777", "relevance_score": 211.06332, "publication_year": 1998, "title": "Digital radiology using active matrix readout of amorphous selenium: Detectors with high voltage protection", "cited_by_count": 39, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Active matrix", "level": 4, "score": 0.7519846}, {"display_name": "Pixel", "level": 2, "score": 0.6800002}, {"display_name": "Flat panel detector", "level": 3, "score": 0.64569914}, {"display_name": "Thin-film transistor", "level": 3, "score": 0.6442522}, {"display_name": "Detector", "level": 2, "score": 0.60310256}, {"display_name": "Optoelectronics", "level": 1, "score": 0.5486761}, {"display_name": "Voltage", "level": 2, "score": 0.5442661}, {"display_name": "Transistor", "level": 3, "score": 0.5269053}, {"display_name": "Digital radiography", "level": 3, "score": 0.49658734}, {"display_name": "Image sensor", "level": 2, "score": 0.4410198}, {"display_name": "Threshold voltage", "level": 4, "score": 0.43161157}, {"display_name": "X-ray detector", "level": 3, "score": 0.4283924}, {"display_name": "High voltage", "level": 3, "score": 0.41737098}, {"display_name": "Electrical engineering", "level": 1, "score": 0.39645308}, {"display_name": "Optics", "level": 1, "score": 0.39323235}, {"display_name": "Layer (electronics)", "level": 2, "score": 0.25811267}, {"display_name": "Radiography", "level": 2, "score": 0.23299184}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"A": [0], "flat-panel": [1], "x-ray": [2, 118, 228, 267], "imaging": [3, 231, 268], "detector": [4, 14, 113, 249], "is": [5, 31, 65, 99, 163, 170, 241], "being": [6], "investigated": [7], "for": [8, 143, 164, 176, 230, 265], "digital": [9], "radiography": [10], "and": [11, 115, 167, 196, 224, 239], "fluoroscopy.": [12], "The": [13, 71, 226], "uses": [15], "a": [16, 27, 37, 55, 102, 135, 141, 157, 185, 206, 252], "layer": [17, 51], "of": [18, 40, 61, 79, 217], "amorphous": [19], "selenium": [20], "(-Se)": [21], "to": [22, 26, 47, 52, 67, 86, 134, 172], "convert": [23], "x": [24, 53], "rays": [25], "charge": [28, 199], "image,": [29], "which": [30, 73], "then": [32], "electronically": [33], "read": [34], "out": [35], "with": [36, 233, 244], "two-dimensional": [38], "array": [39], "thin": [41], "film": [42], "transistors": [43], "(TFTs).": [44], "In": [45, 211], "order": [46, 60], "sensitize": [48], "the": [49, 59, 76, 80, 96, 127, 130, 145, 168, 173, 181, 188, 193, 202, 214, 248, 261], "-Se": [50, 81], "rays,": [54], "high": [56, 88, 148, 177, 234], "voltage": [57, 89, 128, 149, 178, 235], "(of": [58], "several": [62], "thousand": [63], "volts)": [64], "applied": [66], "its": [68], "top": [69], "surface.": [70], "TFTs,": [72], "are": [74, 83, 220, 237], "at": [75], "bottom": [77], "surface": [78], "layer,": [82], "not": [84], "subjected": [85], "any": [87], "under": [90, 101, 151], "normal": [91], "radiological": [92], "operational": [93], "conditions": [94], "since": [95], "pixel": [97, 174, 182, 208, 227, 254], "potential": [98, 183, 256], "However": [100], "fault": [103, 153], "condition": [104], "where": [105], "these": [106], "two": [107], "events": [108], "occur": [109], "simultaneously:": [110], "(1)": [111], "suspended": [112], "scan;": [114], "(2)": [116], "an": [117], "exposure": [119], "more": [120], "than": [121, 125], "ten": [122], "times": [123], "higher": [124], "normal,": [126], "on": [129, 192], "TFTs": [131, 146, 219], "could": [132], "rise": [133], "damaging": [136, 186], "value.": [137], "This": [138], "paper": [139], "describes": [140], "method": [142], "protecting": [144], "from": [147, 201], "damage": [150], "this": [152, 212], "condition.": [154], "It": [155], "employs": [156], "dual-gate": [158, 218], "TFT": [159, 194, 246], "structure,": [160], "one": [161], "gate": [162, 190], "scanning": [165], "control": [166], "other": [169], "connected": [171], "electrode": [175], "protection.": [179], "Before": [180], "reaches": [184], "value,": [187], "protection": [189, 236], "turns": [191], "automatically": [195], "drains": [197], "excess": [198], "away": [200], "pixels": [203], "thus": [204], "providing": [205], "safe": [207, 253], "saturation": [209, 255], "potential.": [210], "paper,": [213], "characteristic": [215], "curves": [216], "studied": [221], "both": [222], "theoretically": [223], "experimentally.": [225], "response": [229], "detectors": [232], "predicted,": [238], "it": [240], "shown": [242], "that": [243], "practical": [245], "designs": [247], "can": [250], "provide": [251], "as": [257, 259], "well": [258], "satisfy": [260], "dynamic": [262], "range": [263], "required": [264], "diagnostic": [266], "applications.": [269]}, "authors": ["Wei Zhao", "J.

The detector uses a layer of amorphous selenium (-Se) to convert x rays to a charge image, which is then electronically read out with a two-dimensional array of thin film transistors (TFTs). In order to sensitize the -Se layer to x rays, a high voltage (of the order of several thousand volts) is applied to its top surface. The TFTs, which are at the bottom surface of the -Se layer, are not subjected to any high voltage under normal radiological operational conditions since the pixel potential is However under a fault condition where these two events occur simultaneously: (1) suspended detector scan; and (2) an x-ray exposure more than ten times higher than normal, the voltage on the TFTs could rise to a damaging value. This paper describes a method for protecting the TFTs from high voltage damage under this fault condition. It employs a dual-gate TFT structure, one gate is for scanning control and the other is connected to the pixel electrode for high voltage protection. Before the pixel potential reaches a damaging value, the protection gate turns on the TFT automatically and drains excess charge away from the pixels thus providing a safe pixel saturation potential. In this paper, the characteristic curves of dual-gate TFTs are studied both theoretically and experimentally. The pixel x-ray response for imaging detectors with high voltage protection are predicted, and it is shown that with practical TFT designs the detector can provide a safe pixel saturation potential as well as satisfy the dynamic range required for diagnostic x-ray imaging applications."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W1967415872", "relevance_score": 196.22275, "publication_year": 2009, "title": "Functional and radiological outcome after delayed fixation of femoral neck fractures in pediatric patients", "cited_by_count": 39, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Femoral neck", "level": 3, "score": 0.7116787}, {"display_name": "Surgery", "level": 1, "score": 0.6652893}, {"display_name": "Radiological weapon", "level": 2, "score": 0.610748}, {"display_name": "Orthopedic surgery", "level": 2, "score": 0.600057}, {"display_name": "Fixation (population genetics)", "level": 3, "score": 0.5890969}, {"display_name": "Femoral head", "level": 2, "score": 0.5138514}, {"display_name": "Prospective cohort study", "level": 2, "score": 0.46751052}, {"display_name": "Sports medicine", "level": 2, "score": 0.43650007}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Complications": [0], "that": [1], "develop": [2], "after": [3, 24, 117, 128], "femoral": [4, 28, 86, 220, 229], "neck": [5, 29, 87, 221], "fracture": [6, 18, 198, 216, 254], "in": [7, 31, 41, 64, 84, 88, 215, 271], "children-especially": [8], "osteonecrosis-have": [9], "been": [10], "retrospectively": [11], "attributed": [12], "to": [13, 47, 68, 175, 248, 267], "inadvertent": [14], "delayed": [15, 25, 77, 197, 272], "fixation": [16, 26, 56, 78, 108, 199, 217], "and": [17, 44, 54, 71, 196, 206, 236, 250, 257, 274], "type.": [19], "Prospective": [20], "evaluation": [21, 46, 73], "of": [22, 27, 51, 61, 81, 137, 147, 158, 168, 194, 200, 218, 227, 233], "results": [23], "fractures": [30, 83, 152], "children": [32, 90], "beyond": [33], "the": [34, 42, 52, 59, 85, 135, 169, 219, 228, 269], "first": [35], "24": [36], "h": [37], "is": [38, 222, 245], "not": [39, 265], "reported": [40], "literature": [43], "requires": [45], "increase": [48], "our": [49], "understanding": [50], "procedure": [53], "improve": [55], "methods.": [57], "Also,": [58], "role": [60], "capsular": [62], "decompression": [63, 263], "initial": [65], "management": [66], "needs": [67], "be": [69], "elucidated.Radiological": [70], "functional": [72], "was": [74, 100, 109, 172, 185], "done": [75, 110], "for": [76, 144], "(>24": [79], "h)": [80], "displaced": [82], "21": [89], "(21": [91], "hips)": [92], "treated": [93], "over": [94], "11": [95], "years.": [96, 106], "Mean": [97], "patient": [98], "age": [99], "11.8": [101], "(median": [102], "12,": [103], "range": [104], "5-15)": [105], "Extraphyseal": [107], "using": [111], "partially": [112], "threaded": [113], "cannulated": [114], "cancellous": [115], "screws": [116], "closed": [118], "or": [119], "open": [120, 207, 251], "reduction.": [121], "Patients": [122, 141], "were": [123, 132, 142], "allowed": [124], "full": [125], "weight": [126], "bearing": [127], "12-18": [129], "weeks.": [130, 162], "Results": [131], "assessed": [133], "on": [134], "basis": [136], "modified": [138], "Ratliff": [139], "criteria.": [140], "followed": [143], "a": [145, 155, 186], "mean": [146, 156], "81": [148], "(range": [149, 160], "66-129)": [150], "months.All": [151], "united": [153], "at": [154], "duration": [157], "12": [159], "10.6-14)": [161], "Three": [163], "(14.3%)": [164], "patients": [165], "had": [166], "osteonecrosis": [167, 195, 226], "hip,": [170], "which": [171], "significantly": [173], "related": [174], "poor": [176], "outcome": [177, 270], "(r": [178, 189], "=": [179, 182, 190, 204, 210], "0.495;": [180], "P": [181], "0.022).": [183], "There": [184], "significant": [187, 242], "correlation": [188], "0.52)": [191], "between": [192], "development": [193], ">10": [201], "days": [202], "(P": [203, 209], "0.016)": [205], "reduction": [208], "0.016).Outcome": [211], "following": [212], "temporal": [213], "delay": [214, 249], "primarily": [223, 246], "affected": [224], "by": [225], "head,": [230], "whereas": [231, 253], "restriction": [232], "movements,": [234], "shortening,": [235], "premature": [237], "physeal": [238], "closure": [239], "has": [240], "no": [241], "influence.": [243], "Osteonecrosis": [244], "linked": [247], "reduction,": [252], "type,": [255], "age,": [256], "sex": [258], "seem": [259, 266], "insignificant": [260], "factors.": [261], "Capsular": [262], "does": [264], "affect": [268], "presentations": [273], "may": [275], "hinder": [276], "definitive": [277], "treatment.": [278]}, "authors": ["Manish Kumar Varshney", "Ashok Kumar", "Shah Alam Khan", "Shishir Rastogi"], "abstract": "Complications that develop after femoral neck fracture in children-especially osteonecrosis-have been retrospectively attributed to inadvertent delayed fixation and fracture type.

Patients were allowed full weight bearing after 12-18 weeks. Results were assessed on the basis of modified Ratliff criteria. Patients were followed for a mean of 81 (range 66-129) months.All fractures united at a mean duration of 12 (range 10.6-14) weeks. Three (14.3%) patients had osteonecrosis of the hip, which was significantly related to poor outcome (r = 0.495; P = 0.022). There was a significant correlation (r = 0.52) between development of osteonecrosis and delayed fracture fixation of >10 days (P = 0.016) and open reduction (P = 0.016).Outcome following temporal delay in fracture fixation of the femoral neck is primarily affected by osteonecrosis of the femoral head, whereas restriction of movements, shortening, and premature physeal closure has no significant influence. Osteonecrosis is primarily linked to delay and open reduction, whereas fracture type, age, and sex seem insignificant factors. Capsular decompression does not seem to affect the outcome in delayed presentations and may hinder definitive treatment."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2113347975", "relevance_score": 193.41486, "publication_year": 2011, "title": "State-of-the-art radiological techniques improve the assessment of postoperative lung function in patients with non-small cell lung cancer", "cited_by_count": 39, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Perfusion", "level": 2, "score": 0.7137604}, {"display_name": "Nuclear medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.697801}, {"display_name": "Lung cancer", "level": 2, "score": 0.6193175}, {"display_name": "Lung", "level": 2, "score": 0.57790697}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.5189531}, {"display_name": "Radiological weapon", "level": 2, "score": 0.47764125}, {"display_name": "Perfusion scanning", "level": 3, "score": 0.47279045}, {"display_name": "Pulmonary function testing", "level": 2, "score": 0.43609476}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"The": [0, 161, 190], "purpose": [1], "of": [2, 21, 35, 59, 117, 119, 145, 163, 192, 194, 208], "this": [3], "study": [4, 56], "was": [5, 83, 99], "to": [6], "compare": [7], "predictive": [8], "capabilities": [9], "for": [10, 68, 95, 111, 125, 143], "postoperative": [11, 80, 222], "lung": [12, 17, 64, 104, 223], "function": [13, 224], "in": [14, 225], "non-small": [15], "cell": [16], "cancer": [18], "(NSCLC)": [19], "patients": [20, 71, 227], "the": [22, 102, 115], "state-of-the-art": [23], "radiological": [24, 218], "methods": [25, 45, 219], "including": [26], "perfusion": [27, 78, 195], "MRI,": [28, 52, 79, 179], "quantitative": [29, 96, 180, 198], "CT": [30, 181, 199, 210], "and": [31, 41, 50, 57, 62, 74, 92, 108, 121, 124, 133, 182, 201, 215], "SPECT/CT": [32, 183, 202], "with": [33, 141, 152, 173], "that": [34], "anatomical": [36], "method": [37], "(i.e.": [38], "qualitative": [39, 112, 209], "CT)": [40], "traditional": [42, 231], "nuclear": [43, 54, 126], "medicine": [44, 55, 127], "such": [46], "as": [47], "planar": [48, 212], "imaging": [49, 213], "SPECT.Perfusion": [51], "CT,": [53, 97, 113], "measurements": [58], "%FEV(1)": [60, 81], "before": [61], "after": [63, 159], "resection": [65], "were": [66, 138, 149, 156, 165, 204], "performed": [67], "229": [69], "NSCLC": [70, 226], "(125": [72], "men": [73], "104": [75], "women).": [76], "For": [77], "(po%FEV(1))": [82], "predicted": [84, 100, 168], "from": [85, 101, 114, 129], "semi-quantitatively": [86], "assessed": [87], "blood": [88], "volumes": [89, 105], "within": [90, 106, 131], "total": [91, 107, 120, 132], "resected": [93, 109, 122, 134], "lungs,": [94, 110, 123], "it": [98], "functional": [103], "number": [116], "segments": [118], "studies,": [128], "uptakes": [130], "lungs.": [135], "All": [136], "SPECTs": [137], "automatically": [139], "co-registered": [140], "CTs": [142], "preparation": [144], "SPECT/CTs.": [146], "Predicted": [147], "po%FEV(1)s": [148, 169, 175], "then": [150], "correlated": [151], "actual": [153, 174], "po%FEV(1)s,": [154], "which": [155], "measured": [157], "%FEV(1)s": [158], "operation.": [160], "limits": [162, 191], "agreement": [164, 193], "also": [166], "evaluated.All": [167], "showed": [170], "good": [171], "correlation": [172, 186], "(0.83\u2264r\u22640.88,": [176], "p<0.0001).": [177], "Perfusion": [178], "demonstrated": [184], "better": [185], "than": [187, 206, 230], "other": [188], "methods.": [189, 232], "MRI": [196], "(4.4\u00b114.2%),": [197], "(4.7\u00b114.2%)": [200], "(5.1\u00b114.7%)": [203], "less": [205], "those": [207], "(6.0\u00b117.4%),": [211], "(5.8\u00b118.2%),": [214], "SPECT": [216], "(5.5\u00b116.8%).State-of-the-art": [217], "can": [220], "predict": [221], "more": [228], "accurately": [229]}, "authors": ["Yoshiharu Ohno", "Hisanobu Koyama", "Munenobu Nogami", "Daisuke Takenaka", "Yoshiaki Onishi", "Keiko Matsumoto", "Shinsuke Matsumoto", "Yoshimasa Maniwa", "Masahiro Yoshimura", "Yoshihiro Nishimura", "Kazuro Sugimura"], "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to compare predictive capabilities for postoperative lung function in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients of the state-of-the-art radiological methods including perfusion MRI, quantitative CT and SPECT/CT with that of anatomical method (i.e. qualitative CT) and traditional nuclear medicine methods such as planar imaging and SPECT.Perfusion MRI, CT, nuclear medicine study and measurements of %FEV(1) before and after lung resection were performed for 229 NSCLC patients (125 men and 104 women). For perfusion MRI, postoperative %FEV(1) (po%FEV(1)) was predicted from semi-quantitatively assessed blood volumes within total and resected lungs, for quantitative CT, it was predicted from the functional lung volumes within total and resected lungs, for qualitative CT, from the number of segments of total and resected lungs, and for nuclear medicine studies, from uptakes within total and resected lungs. All SPECTs were automatically co-registered with CTs for preparation of SPECT/CTs. Predicted po%FEV(1)s were then correlated with actual po%FEV(1)s, which were measured %FEV(1)s after operation. The limits of agreement were also evaluated.All predicted po%FEV(1)s showed good correlation with actual po%FEV(1)s (0.83\u2264r\u22640.88, p<0.0001).

MATERIAL AND METHODS:The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale and the Chinese Perceived Stress Scale were used to evaluate the resilience and perceived stress of 600 medical staff members from the radiology departments in 32 public hospitals in Sichuan Province, China, respectively. Multiple linear regression was used to analyze factors related to resilience. RESULTS:The total resilience score was 65.76\u00b117.26, wherein the toughness dimension score was 33.61\u00b19.52, the strength dimension score was 21.25\u00b15.50, and the optimism dimension score was 10.91\u00b13.15. There was a significant negative correlation between perceived stress and resilience (r=\u20130.635, P<0.001). According to multivariate analysis, the total perceived stress score (\u03b2=\u20131.318, P<0.001), gender (\u03b2=\u20134.738, P<0.001), knowledge of COVID-19 (\u03b2=2.884, P=0.043), knowledge of COVID-19 protective measures (\u03b2=3.260, P=0.042), and availability of adequate protective materials (\u03b2=\u20131.268, P=0.039) were independent influencing factors for resilience. CONCLUSIONS:The resilience level of the medical staff in the radiology departments during the outbreak of COVID-19 was generally low, particularly regarding toughness. More attention should be paid to resilience influence factors such as high perceived stress, female gender, lack of understanding of COVID-19 and protective measures, and lack of protective materials, and targeted interventions should be undertaken to improve the resilience level of the medical staff in the radiology departments during the outbreak of COVID-19."}, {"id":

The objectives were to assess the state of the level of evidence and a first step towards a consensus document for currently employed imaging techniques to guide future clinical use, to elucidate the issue of reimbursement structures and health economy, and finally to define the need for appropriate educational programmes to ensure clinical competence for electrophysiologists, imaging specialists, and radiologists."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W3102090163", "relevance_score": 427.12, "publication_year": 2021, "title": "Artificial intelligence in oral and maxillofacial radiology: what is currently possible?", "cited_by_count": 38, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Artificial intelligence", "level": 1, "score": 0.6214617}, {"display_name": "Field (mathematics)", "level": 2, "score": 0.5211223}, {"display_name": "Deep learning", "level": 2, "score": 0.46597266}, {"display_name": "Medical physics", "level": 1, "score": 0.33401197}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Artificial": [0, 75], "intelligence,": [1, 168, 188], "which": [2, 64, 122], "has": [3], "been": [4, 82], "actively": [5], "applied": [6], "in": [7, 13, 41, 55, 78, 134, 138, 194, 205, 241, 248], "a": [8, 124, 153, 237], "broad": [9], "range": [10], "of": [11, 20, 35, 44, 87, 100, 110, 144, 156, 162, 166, 186, 208, 214, 220, 232, 244], "industries": [12], "recent": [14], "years,": [15], "is": [16, 26, 113, 123, 198], "an": [17, 202], "active": [18], "area": [19], "interest": [21], "for": [22, 84, 115], "many": [23], "researchers.": [24], "Dentistry": [25], "no": [27], "exception": [28], "to": [29, 104, 129, 146, 178, 200], "this": [30, 79, 249], "trend,": [31], "and": [32, 46, 73, 94, 108, 118, 169, 197, 217], "the": [33, 42, 85, 139, 163, 184, 195, 206, 212, 218, 230, 242], "applications": [34, 247], "artificial": [36, 53, 132, 167, 174, 187, 189, 245], "intelligence": [37, 54, 76, 133, 190, 246], "are": [38, 102, 142, 181], "particularly": [39], "promising": [40], "field": [43, 80], "oral": [45], "maxillofacial": [47], "(OMF)": [48], "radiology.": [49], "Recent": [50], "researches": [51], "on": [52], "OMF": [56, 111, 223], "radiology": [57], "have": [58, 81], "mainly": [59], "used": [60], "convolutional": [61], "neural": [62], "networks,": [63], "can": [65], "perform": [66], "image": [67, 90, 95], "classification,": [68], "detection,": [69], "segmentation,": [70], "registration,": [71], "generation,": [72], "refinement.": [74], "systems": [77], "developed": [83], "purposes": [86], "radiographic": [88, 233], "diagnosis,": [89], "analysis,": [91], "forensic": [92], "dentistry,": [93], "quality": [96], "improvement.": [97], "Tremendous": [98], "amounts": [99], "data": [101, 120, 159], "needed": [103], "achieve": [105], "good": [106], "results,": [107], "involvement": [109], "radiologist": [112], "essential": [114], "making": [116], "accurate": [117], "consistent": [119], "sets,": [121], "time-consuming": [125], "task.": [126], "In": [127], "order": [128], "widely": [130], "use": [131], "actual": [135], "clinical": [136], "practice": [137], "future,": [140], "there": [141], "lots": [143], "problems": [145, 180], "be": [147], "solved,": [148], "such": [149], "as": [150, 225], "building": [151], "up": [152], "huge": [154], "amount": [155], "fine-labeled": [157], "open": [158], "set,": [160], "understanding": [161], "judgment": [164], "criteria": [165], "DICOM": [170], "hacking": [171], "threats": [172], "using": [173], "intelligence.": [175], "If": [176], "solutions": [177], "these": [179], "presented": [182], "with": [183], "development": [185, 207, 243], "will": [191, 235], "develop": [192], "further": [193], "future": [196], "expected": [199], "play": [201, 236], "important": [203, 239], "role": [204, 240], "automatic": [209], "diagnosis": [210], "systems,": [211], "establishment": [213], "treatment": [215, 221], "plans,": [216], "fabrication": [219], "tools.": [222], "radiologists,": [224], "professionals": [226], "who": [227], "thoroughly": [228], "understand": [229], "characteristics": [231], "images,": [234], "very": [238], "field.": [250]}, "authors": ["Min-Suk Heo", "Jo\u2010Eun Kim", "Jae-Joon Hwang", "Sang-Sun Han", "Jin-Soo Kim", "Won-Jin Yi", "In-Woo Park"], "abstract": "Artificial intelligence, which has been actively applied in a broad range of industries in recent years, is an active area of interest for many researchers. Dentistry is no exception to this trend, and the applications of artificial intelligence are particularly promising in the field of oral and maxillofacial (OMF) radiology. Recent researches on artificial intelligence in OMF radiology have mainly used convolutional neural networks, which can perform image classification, detection, segmentation, registration, generation, and refinement. Artificial intelligence systems in this field have been developed for the purposes of radiographic diagnosis, image analysis, forensic dentistry, and image quality improvement. Tremendous amounts of data are needed to achieve good results, and involvement of OMF radiologist is essential for making accurate and consistent data sets, which is a time-consuming task. In order to widely use artificial intelligence in actual clinical practice in the future, there are lots of problems to be solved, such as building up a huge amount of fine-labeled open data set, understanding of the judgment criteria of artificial intelligence, and DICOM hacking threats using artificial intelligence. If solutions to these problems are presented with the development of artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence will develop further in the future and is expected to play an important role in the development of automatic diagnosis systems, the establishment of treatment plans, and the fabrication of treatment tools.

This paper is devoted to the spatial design of such a network. Here, any potential network is judged on its ability to extrapolate activity concentrations measured on the network stations over the whole domain. The performance of a network is quantitatively assessed through a cost function that measures the discrepancy between the extrapolation and the true concentration fields. These true fields are obtained through the computation of a database of dispersion accidents over one year of meteorology and originating from 20 French nuclear sites. A close to optimal network is then looked for using a simulated annealing optimisation. The results emphasise the importance of the cost function in the design of a network aimed at monitoring an accidental dispersion. Several choices of norm used in the cost function are studied and give way to different designs. The influence of the number of stations is discussed.

Using simple concept matching techniques, such as lexicon based comparisons, is typically not sufficient to determine an accurate measure of similarity. In this study, we tested an enhancement to the standard document vector cosine similarity model in which ontological parent\u2013child (is-a) relationships are exploited. For a given concept, we define a semantic vector consisting of all parent concepts and their corresponding weights as determined by the shortest distance between the concept and parent after accounting for all possible paths. Similarity between the two concepts is then determined by taking the cosine angle between the two corresponding vectors. To test the improvement over the non-semantic document vector cosine similarity model, we measured the similarity between groups of reports arising from similar clinical contexts, including anatomy and imaging procedure. We further applied the similarity metrics within a k-nearest-neighbor (k-NN) algorithm to classify reports based on their anatomical and procedure based groups. 2150 production CT radiology reports (952 abdomen reports and 1128 neuro reports) were used in testing with SNOMED CT, restricted to Body structure, Clinical finding and Procedure branches, as the reference ontology. The semantic algorithm preferentially increased the intra-class similarity over the inter-class similarity, with a 0.07 and 0.08 mean increase in the neuro\u2013neuro and abdomen\u2013abdomen pairs versus a 0.04 mean increase in the neuro\u2013abdomen pairs. Using leave-one-out cross-validation in which each document was iteratively used as a test sample while excluding it from the training data, the k-NN based classification accuracy was shown in all cases to be consistently higher with the semantics based measure compared with the non-semantic case. Moreover, the accuracy remained steady even as k value was increased \u2013 for the two anatomy related classes accuracy for k = 41 was 93.1% with semantics compared to 86.7% without semantics. Similarly, for the eight imaging procedures related classes, accuracy (for k = 41) with semantics was 63.8% compared to 60.2% without semantics. At the same k, accuracy improved significantly to 82.8% and 77.4% respectively when procedures were logically grouped together into four classes (such as ignoring contrast information in the imaging procedure description). Similar results were seen at other k-values. The addition of semantic context into the document vector space model improves the ability of the cosine similarity to differentiate between radiology reports of different anatomical and image procedure-based classes. This effect can be leveraged for document classification tasks, which suggests its potential applicability for biomedical information retrieval."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W1994787259",

We studied this pattern in terms of upper canine inclination and its relation to the lateral incisor, on the basis of the panoramic radiographic records of 305 children aged 4 to 12 years. The study sample comprised 554 maxillary canines in the oral pre-emergence phase of eruption. Subject age, sex, inclination of the canine (CI), its relation to the lateral incisor (RCLI), and development of the lateral incisor (DLI) were evaluated. The results show that the canine erupts, increasing its inclination mesially until a maximum is reached, at about 9 years of age, after which the tooth begins to progressively upright itself. The individual variability of the degree of CI at a given age is considerable. In the initial stages, the RCLI is most commonly characterized by overlapping, a situation rarely seen in the final stages. The DLI effectively discriminates both periods, because when DLI is incomplete, more than half of the cases have an overlapping RCLI. In contrast, when the DLI is complete, this overlapping is seen in only 7% to 11% of the cases. This variable therefore increases the capacity to detect a possible eruptive anomaly at an early stage. In patients with complete DLI and overlapping, RCLI, particularly when associated with other clinical sings such as the nonpalpation of the cuspid bulge in the alveolar process, the presence of dental agenesis, ankylosis, malformations, or ectopic eruptions, extraction of the primary canine is advised to prevent impaction.

By RWS navigation we include its underlying mental model or metaphor, and the commands and hand motions used to access patient folders and to display images. For the last 5 years, the University of North Carolina (UNC) Medical Image Display Research Group has analyzed the primary interpretation task and designed, developed, and evaluated the FilmPlane series of RWS prototypes. This work has helped us understand both RWS requirements and viable design approaches. In this paper, we present our workstation design strategy and our observations and understanding of the issues and problems with RWS navigation. To illustrate the discussion, we describe FilmPlane2, the UNC radiology workstation. We also briefly detail three rapid-evaluation techniques (including two observer experiments) for quickly gaining feedback on a design. These observations and evaluation techniques may aid other RWS designers in producing superior tools for the clinicians."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2004819765", "relevance_score": 200.95277,

From 1946 through 1958, 66 atomic weapons were detonated in the island country. For several decades, monitoring was conducted by the U.S. Department of Energy (or its predecessor agencies) on the test site atolls and neighboring atolls. However, 70% of the land area of the over 1,200 islands in the Marshall Islands was never systematically monitored prior to 1990. For the 5-y period from 1990 through 1994, the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands undertook an independent program to assess the radiological conditions throughout its 29 atolls. The scientific work was performed under the auspices of the Section 177 Agreement of the Compact of Free Association, U.S. public law 99-239, signed in 1986 by President Ronald Reagan. Although the total land area of the nations is a scant 180 km2, the islands are distributed over 6 x 10(5) km2 of ocean. Consequently, logistics and instrumentation were main considerations, in addition to cultural and language issues. The core of the monitoring program was in-situ gamma spectrometry measurements made on more than 400 islands. Native foods including coconuts and other tropical fruits were sampled as well as more than 200 soil profiles and more than 800 surface soil samples. The fruits, soil profiles and surface soil samples have been analyzed for all gamma emitters with an emphasis on determining concentrations of 137Cs; the surface soil samples were also analyzed for 239+240Pu. All measurements were conducted in a radiological laboratory built in the capital city of the Marshall Islands specifically for the purposes of this study. The program was extensively assisted in the field and in the laboratory by Marshallese workers. The interpretation of environmental radiation data in the Marshall Islands required thoughtful analysis because the atolls lie along a latitude and precipitation gradient that effected the deposition of local and global fallout. The objective of this paper is to report findings for all atolls of the Marshall Islands on the 137Cs areal inventory (Bq m(-2)) and the external effective dose-rate (mSv y(-1)), the projected internal effective dose-rate (mSv y(-1)) from an assumed diet model, and surface soil concentrations of 239,240Pu (Bq kg(-1)) for selected northern atolls. Interpretation is also provided on the degree of contamination above global fallout levels.

A total of 1012 pedicle screws were inserted in 83 patients using a spine robot (group A), 886 screws were implanted in 75 patients using a drill guide template (group B), and 1276 screws were inserted in 109 patients using CT-based navigation (group C). Screw positions were evaluated using postoperative CT scans according to the Gertzbein and Robbins classification. Other relevant data were also collected. Perfect pedicle screw insertion (Grade A) accuracy in groups A, B, and C was 91.3%, 81.3%, and 84.1%, respectively. Clinically acceptable accuracy of screw implantation (Grades A + B) respectively was 96.0%, 90.6%, and 93.0%.

Current training programs consist mainly of theoretical instruction in C-arm operation, the physical foundations of radiography, and radiation avoidance, and are largely lacking in hands-on application. A computer-based simulation program such as that tested by the authors may be one way to improve the effectiveness of C-arm training. In computer simulations of various scenarios commonly encountered in the operating room, trainees using the virtX program interact with three-dimensional models to test their knowledge base and improve their skill levels. Radiographs showing the simulated patient anatomy and surgical implants are \"reconstructed\" from data computed on the basis of the trainee's positioning of models of a C-arm, patient, and table, and are displayed in real time on the desktop monitor. Trainee performance is signaled in real time by color graphics in several control panels and, on completion of the exercise, is compared in detail with the performance of an expert operator. Testing of this computer-based training program in continuing medical education courses for operating room personnel showed an improvement in the overall understanding of underlying principles of intraoperative radiography performed with a C-arm, with resultant higher image quality, lower overall radiation exposure, and greater time efficiency.

Assessing vulnerable patients can potentially lead to interventions that improve surgical outcomes. Anaesthesiologists who care for older patients can identify frailty to improve preoperative risk stratification and subsequent perioperative planning. Numerous clinical tools to diagnose frailty exist, but none has emerged as the standard tool to be used in clinical practice. Radiological modalities, such as computed tomography and ultrasonography, are widely performed before surgery, and are therefore available to be used opportunistically to objectively evaluate surrogate markers of frailty. This review presents the importance of frailty assessment by anaesthesiologists; lists common clinical tools that have been applied; and proposes that utilising radiological imaging as an objective surrogate measure of frailty is a novel, expanding approach for which anaesthesiologists can significantly contribute to broad implementation. Frailty is a syndrome of cumulative decline across multiple physiological systems, which predisposes vulnerable adults to adverse events. Assessing vulnerable patients can potentially lead to interventions that improve surgical outcomes. Anaesthesiologists who care for older patients can identify frailty to improve preoperative risk stratification and subsequent perioperative planning.

Radiological modalities, such as computed tomography and ultrasonography, are widely performed before surgery, and are therefore available to be used opportunistically to objectively evaluate surrogate markers of frailty. This review presents the importance of frailty assessment by anaesthesiologists; lists common clinical tools that have been applied; and proposes that utilising radiological imaging as an objective surrogate measure of frailty is a novel, expanding approach for which anaesthesiologists can significantly contribute to broad implementation. Ageing is accompanied by a gradual loss of reserve across multiple organ systems, which leads to an increased risk of poor health outcomes after an illness or injury.1Robertson D.A. Savva G.M.

Although frailty intersects with co-morbidity and disability, they are not synonymous.3Fried L.P. Tangen C.M.

The original definition of frailty phenotype, developed almost two decades ago, tests unintentional weight loss, exhaustion, muscle weakness, slowness whilst walking, and low levels of activity.3Fried L.P.

Interdisciplinary experts agree that frailty is a multidimensional syndrome characterised by decreased reserve and diminished resistance to stressors; however, no single definition of frailty has been agreed upon4Rodr\u00edguez-Ma\u00f1as L.

However, many clinical tools to measure frailty require patient participation (e.g. grip strength, gait speed, and cognitive testing). Whilst these tasks are feasible for community-dwelling older adults, this is not the case for patients who are ill, injured, or in pain. Accordingly, in many scenarios encountered by anaesthesiologists, objective, simple markers of frailty that do not require patient participation are necessary. This review presents common frailty assessment instruments, and discusses radiological modalities that are useful and feasible for identifying frail patients in clinical situations familiar to anaesthesiologists. Opportunistic radiological studies are an objective source of surrogate markers for physical frailty. The broad implementation of available tools to better identify the frail patient will increase awareness and could improve outcomes in the perioperative and critical care setting. Anaesthesiologists should utilise frailty assessment in a myriad of clinical settings. Whilst this will require a change in common practice, resources should be deployed in preoperative assessment clinics or health informatics to capture frailty assessments routinely in order to better assess and coordinate care for high-risk surgical patients. Recent reviews show that preoperative frailty assessment provides expanded objective, prognostic information for risk stratification8Lin H.-S. Watts J.N. Peel N.M. Hubbard R.E.

Many healthcare encounters with older adults begin in the emergency department or the ICU setting because of acute trauma or rapid deterioration. Older adults are often admitted to the ICU during periods of acute illness; however, only one of every four adults aged 80 yr and older will return to baseline levels of functioning 1 yr after ICU admission.25Heyland D.K.

The trial involved an intake of 734 patients between 1966 and 1975. The classification of all patients has been revised to conform with the latest TNM publication. A reduction in total dose was made for 3F/wk compared with 5F/wk. This varied between 13% and 11% in centres treating over 3 weeks and 6 weeks, respectively. No statistically significant differences have been found between the two arms (3F/wk versus 5F/wk) of the trial in any of the main group analyses. A number of sub-group analyses relating to survival, tumour-free and laryngectomy-free rates and to the comparison of acute or late normal-tissue radiation damage have also been performed. No differences have been found that could be considered to be statistically significant in relation to the particular sub-group. Previous interim reports suggested minor differences in sub-group analyses between the 3F/wk and 5F/wk regimes in this trial; these have diminished now that the full follow-up data are available.

This article is a consensus statement provided by the Canadian Society of Thoracic Radiology and the Canadian Association of Radiologists outlining the role of imaging in COVID-19 patients. The objectives are to answer key questions related to COVID-19 imaging of the chest and provide guidance for radiologists who are interpreting such studies during this pandemic. The role of chest radiography (CXR), computed tomography (CT), and lung ultrasound is discussed. This document attempts to answer key questions for the imager when dealing with this crisis, such as \u201cWhen is CXR appropriate in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection?\u201d or \u201cHow should a radiologist deal with incidental findings of COVID-19 on CT of the chest done for other indications?\u201d This article also provides recommended reporting structure for CXR and CT, breaking diagnostic possibilities for both CXR and CT into 3 categories: typical, nonspecific, and negative based on imaging findings with representative images provided. Proposed reporting language is also outlined based on this structure. As our understanding of this pandemic evolves, our appreciation for how imaging fits into the workup of patients during this unprecedented time evolves as well.

Although some studies have already reported changes in plantar pressure distribution after calcaneal fracture, no investigation has yet focused on the patient\u2018s strength and postural control. Method 60 patients with unilateral, operatively treated, intra-articular calcaneal fractures were clinically and biomechanically evaluated >1 year postoperatively (physical examination, SF-36, AOFAS score, lower leg isokinetic strength, postural control and gait analysis including plantar pressure distribution). Results were correlated to clinical outcome and preoperative radiological findings (B\u00f6hler angle, Zwipp and Sanders Score). Results Clinical examination revealed a statistically significant reduction in range of motion at the tibiotalar and the subtalar joint on the affected side. Additionally, there was a statistically significant reduction of plantar flexor peak torque of the injured compared to the uninjured limb (p < 0.001) as well as a reduction in postural control that was also more pronounced on the initially injured side (standing duration 4.2 \u00b1 2.9 s vs. 7.6 \u00b1 2.1 s, p < 0.05). Plantar pressure measurements revealed a statistically significant pressure reduction at the hindfoot (p = 0.0007) and a pressure increase at the midfoot (p = 0.0001) and beneath the lateral forefoot (p = 0.037) of the injured foot. There was only a weak correlation between radiological classifications and clinical outcome but a moderate correlation between strength differences and the clinical questionnaires (CC 0.27\u20130.4) as well as between standing duration and the clinical questionnaires. Although thigh circumference was also reduced on the injured side, there was no important relationship between changes in lower leg circumference and strength suggesting that measurement of leg circumference may not be a valid assessment of maximum strength deficits. Self-selected walking speed was the parameter that showed the best correlation with clinical outcome (AOFAS score). Conclusion Calcaneal fractures are associated with a significant reduction in ankle joint ROM, plantar flexion strength and postural control. These impairments seem to be highly relevant to the patients. Restoration of muscular strength and proprioception should therefore be aggressively addressed in the rehabilitation process after these fractures."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2071997109",

Although rarely the primary factor for these suits, this is the one area in medical malpractice litigation in which radiologists can play a crucial role in reducing risk and liability. This article provides some practical tips on how to reduce the risk for being sued and losing. Being sued for medical malpractice has been equated to getting divorced: neither is really over even after a court says it is over. Both leave lasting scars and, in most cases, bad memories. Both are emotionally and financially draining. Both may affect the ability to practice medicine. But only one may directly affect physician\u2019s medical license. Any physician can be sued, regardless of whether there is negligence or not. One in every 4 physicians is sued for malpractice each year, and more than half of all practicing physicians have already been sued [1Brownell J. The stress of malpractice litigation.Med Risk Manage Advis. 2005; 13: 1-3Google Scholar]. Malpractice litigation is such a frequent occurrence, and so stressful, that there is a name for the feelings experienced by many physicians who are sued for malpractice: malpractice stress syndrome [2Sanbar S.S. Firestone M.H. Reaction of physicians to malpractice litigation medical malpractice stress syndrome.in: Sanbar S.S. Medical malpractice survival handbook. Elsevier, Philadelphia, Pa2006Google Scholar]. On learning that they are involved in litigation, physicians often experience feelings of guilt and shame, as well as great doubts about their confidence. Physicians tend to isolate themselves from friends, family members, and colleagues, fearing that they will experience criticism and disapproval. This isolation is probably the most detrimental reaction. Some physicians will have an overwhelming desire to talk to anyone and everyone about their cases in an attempt to validate what they did as being correct. Malpractice stress syndrome can persist for years, even with physicians who have won malpractice lawsuits. Physicians who can successfully cope with the stress of malpractice litigation are able to intellectually distance themselves from lawsuits and not perceive them as personal attacks. They are also able to understand that other physicians have been sued and that they are not alone in the experience. Finally, they come to see malpractice litigation more as an inherent risk of the profession and less of a measure of personal competence or clinical ability. In the United States, the tort system accounts for approximately $100 billion per year in the field of medicine alone [3Physician Insurers Association of America and American College of RadiologyPractice standard claim survey. Physician Insurers Association of America, Rockville, Md2000Google Scholar]. Over the past 15 years, the average indemnification has doubled for all physicians [3Physician Insurers Association of America and American College of RadiologyPractice standard claim survey. Physician Insurers Association of America, Rockville, Md2000Google Scholar]. Part of this is because the public has become desensitized to large sums of money. Sports figures routinely make several million dollars per year, with an increasing number making tens of millions. The huge pots of money routinely doled out to seemingly average people by lotteries and television quiz shows add to this desensitization. Because of this, jurors seem to have no problem making someone a millionaire, even if they themselves cannot become one. The probability of a physician being sued for medical malpractice in the United States is about 1 in 4 [3Physician Insurers Association of America and American College of RadiologyPractice standard claim survey. Physician Insurers Association of America, Rockville, Md2000Google Scholar]. The incidence of lawsuits has increased in all fields of medicine. What is most alarming is the increase in the number of $1 million or higher jury awards: approximately 45% of jury awards from 1998 to 1999 were $1 million or more, compared with 39% from 1997 to 1998 [3Physician Insurers Association of America and American College of RadiologyPractice standard claim survey. Physician Insurers Association of America, Rockville, Md2000Google Scholar]. This overall increase in jury awards raised the median malpractice award from $750,000 in 1998 to $800,000 in 1999 and to $1 million in 2000 [3Physician Insurers Association of America and American College of RadiologyPractice standard claim survey. Physician Insurers Association of America, Rockville, Md2000Google Scholar]. The average jury award for medical malpractice more than tripled between 1994 and 2000, from $1.1 million to $3.5 million [3Physician Insurers Association of America and American College of RadiologyPractice standard claim survey. Physician Insurers Association of America, Rockville, Md2000Google Scholar]. Going to trial in a medical malpractice case is an expensive ordeal for both sides. When going to trial for the specific liability of childbirth injuries, missed diagnosis of cancer, or delayed treatment, the median award was over $1 million in 2000 [3Physician Insurers Association of America and American College of RadiologyPractice standard claim survey. Physician Insurers Association of America, Rockville, Md2000Google Scholar]. Settling out of court for these 3 specific liabilities was less costly, with the median settlement of $750,0000 for childbirth injuries and $665,000 for delayed treatment. The overall median settlement for all categories was $500,000 in 2000 [3Physician Insurers Association of America and American College of RadiologyPractice standard claim survey. Physician Insurers Association of America, Rockville, Md2000Google Scholar]. Radiology has its own special problem with liability insurance. Whereas the average indemnification has doubled in the past 15 years for all physicians, it has tripled for radiologists [3Physician Insurers Association of America and American College of RadiologyPractice standard claim survey. Physician Insurers Association of America, Rockville, Md2000Google Scholar]. Furthermore, one third of all medical malpractice claims are lost by the radiologist. If a missed diagnosis of breast cancer is alleged, 41% are lost [3Physician Insurers Association of America and American College of RadiologyPractice standard claim survey. Physician Insurers Association of America, Rockville, Md2000Google Scholar]. The most commonly missed diagnoses are breast cancer, lung cancer, and fracture of the spine [3Physician Insurers Association of America and American College of RadiologyPractice standard claim survey. Physician Insurers Association of America, Rockville, Md2000Google Scholar]. Recent statistics presented by Baker and Harkisoon [4Baker S.R. Harkisoon S. The causes of malpractice suits in radiology the contemporary records of 5300 radiologists.in: RSNA scientific posters Radiological Society of North America Scientific Assembly and Annual Meeting Program. Radiological Society of North America, Chicago, Ill2004: 554Google Scholar] at the 2004 annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America analyzed radiology claims from 1990 through 2000. Their study showed that radiologists have a 1 in 3 chance of being sued for medical malpractice. The odds of being sued are the highest in Pennsylvania and Oregon, where more than half of the radiologists practicing have been sued. States where between 40% and 50% of radiologists have been sued, at least once, are Idaho, Illinois, New York, Michigan, New Jersey, Louisiana, and Mississippi. Florida, although infamous for the size of monetary settlements of medical malpractice, actually ranks near the national average. Only 30% to 40% of Florida radiologists have been involved in malpractice claims. Although risk cannot be eliminated, it can be minimized and managed. Reducing risk will reduce exposure to medical malpractice lawsuits. Also, reducing risk is better for patient care and patient safety. There are positive steps that can be taken to reduce the risk for being sued and losing. In studying risk management in radiology, the first step involves identification of the highest areas for risk. Failure to diagnose has been determined to be the number one reason radiologists get sued. Seventy-five percent of radiology lawsuits allege failure to diagnose or failure to communicate in a timely manner [5Berlin L. Berlin J.W. Malpractice and radiologists in Cook County, IL trends in 20 years of litigation.Am J Roentgenol. 1995; 165: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar]. As mentioned, approximately one third of these lawsuits are lost by the radiologist. Mammograms and chest radiographs expose radiologists to the greatest risk in this regard. Once the risk has been identified, it needs to be analyzed to determine if there is a trend or a need for change. After the risk is analyzed, a method must be devised to evaluate and monitor the results. Otherwise, if any change is made, it will not be possible to adequately assess the results of that change. Mistakes are inevitable in the practice of medicine and will occur with even the best-trained radiologists; in fact, the radiology literature reports a 30% error rate in radiology [6Berlin L. Does the \u201cmissed\u201d radiographic diagnosis constitute malpractice?.Radiology. 1997; 123: 523-527Google Scholar]. However, that number refers to images as part of a set of unknowns with proven pathology. The more accurate number for daily work is about 4% [7Siegle R.L. Baram E.M. Reuter S.R. Clarke E.A. Lancaster J.L. McMahan C.A. Rates of disagreement in imaging interpretation in a group of community hospitals.Acad Radiol. 1998; 5: 148-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar]. Nevertheless, it does not help one\u2019s case to claim that 30% of other radiologists would have made the same mistake. The general public has come to expect perfect results from physicians and the facilities in which they practice. Claiming that errors or mistakes are part of the practice of medicine and that one should not be held accountable sounds cold, uncaring, and callous before a jury. The real question is, does the mistake equate to malpractice? The definition of medical malpractice is a legal one and is defined as what a reasonable physician would do under same or similar circumstances. The knowledge of a radiologist only has to be ordinary and average, but it must be reasonable. This is a difficult concept for jurors to understand, because they don\u2019t accept mistakes and expect perfection from doctors. In radiology, more than 70% of errors are perceptual, whereas fewer than 30% are cognitive [8Berlin L. Hendrix R.W. Perceptual errors and negligence.Am J Roentgenol. 1998; 170: 863-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar]. However, a radiologist can also be sued for failure to communicate even a correct interpretation in a timely manner. A poorly worded or incorrect report is rarely the cause for medical malpractice action by itself, but poor imaging reports may leave a physician vulnerable in court, because sloppy work will indicate a sloppy attitude to jurors. Errors in perception are the most common reason a radiologist is sued. These are often referred to as \u201cmisses\u201d or \u201cmissed diagnoses.\u201d These cases are usually settled because radiologists lose most of the time if they go to jury verdicts. Radiologists should thoroughly understand the influence of prior reports on their ability to perceive. Studies have shown that if one looks at a prior negative report before looking at imaging studies, there is a greater chance of missing a significant abnormality than by looking at the imaging studies first [9Berlin L. Malpractice issues in radiology alliterative errors.Am J Roentgenol. 2000; 174: 925-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar]. It is extremely difficult to convince jurors that it was not malpractice for you to miss something that they can obviously see in court. Jurors think, \u201cIf I can see it, why couldn\u2019t he?\u201d However, a Wisconsin Court of Appeals in 1997 held that errors in perception by radiologists viewing radiographs may occur in the absence of negligence [10Department of Regulation and Licensing vs State of Wisconsin Medical Examining Board. 572 NW 2d 508 (1997).Google Scholar]. Although this decision may be useful if a radiologist practices in Wisconsin, it will probably not be helpful if you practice anywhere else. Radiologists need to be aware of alternate presentations of pathology and that certain anatomic sites may warrant special attention because of the difficulty in analyzing them. This is especially true in the mediastinum and retrocardiac region, in which even large lesions can be missed [11Branstetter B. Whetstone J. Phillips J.A. et al.The most frequent diagnostic errors in emergency department preliminary interpretations.in: RSNA scientific posters Radiological Society of North America Scientific Assembly and Annual Meeting Program. Radiological Society of North America, Chicago, Ill2005: 642Google Scholar]. Some perception errors can be minimized by paying proper attention to clinical information when it is available or by obtaining clinical information when it is not. The accuracy of perception may be improved with clinical information. Look at the imaging studies before reading prior reports: if a colleague missed an abnormality, others probably will, because the report may influence reading the imaging studies. Understand that errors will occur even with the best-trained radiologists. The public has come to expect perfect results; it does little to impress a jury that a panel of 10 other board-certified radiologists missed the same lesion. Interpretation errors are cognitive errors in which an abnormality is perceived but is incorrectly identified. For example, a normal structure may be called abnormal. Radiologists win most of these lawsuits that allege only interpretation errors [12Raskin M.M. Why radiologists get sued.Appl Radiol. 2001; 30: 19-21Google Scholar]. An appropriate differential diagnosis may help. Errors can be minimized through continuing education. The old saying that \u201cyou don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know\u201d certainly applies here. If one has never heard of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, it will probably never make the diagnosis. The chances of losing in a lawsuit are less if the actual diagnosis is included in one\u2019s differential diagnosis. As with perception, interpretation can be improved with clinical information [13Loy C.T. Irwig L. Accuracy of diagnostic tests read with and without clinical information a systematic review.JAMA. 2004; 292: 1602-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar]. However, be aware that more things are missed because they are not thought of, rather than because they weren\u2019t known. Follow-up or additional studies to clarify or confirm an impression should be suggested when appropriate [14American College of RadiologyACR practice guideline for communication of diagnostic imaging findings.in: Practice guidelines and technical standards. American College of Radiology, Reston, Va2005: 5-9Google Scholar]. Be familiar with the ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae [15American College of RadiologyACR Appropriateness Criteria. American College of Radiology, Reston, Va2005Google Scholar]. This is especially important if the procedure suggested is not as appropriate as a procedure that one failed to suggest. If one suggests a procedure that is not listed in the ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae, or that is further down the list, the reasons for doing so must be justified in the report. Understand that the next appropriate procedure may not be a radiologic procedure: be aware of all modalities, even if not offered at one\u2019s institution. Sometimes, a follow-up study may be the most appropriate procedure. In reality, radiologists are rarely sued for failing to perform or suggest additional imaging procedures. The failure to perform an additional imaging test was relevant in only 21 of 3,000 claims filed against radiologists between 1990 and 2000, or less than 1% [16Brice J. Malpractice data challenge defensive radiology stance.Diagn Imaging. 2005; 27: 9-10Google Scholar]. So, there is not much to worry about, unless one happens to be one of those 21 radiologists. The failure to communicate significant abnormal findings in a timely manner is one of the greatest problems facing radiologists today. It is a causal factor in 80% of all lawsuits, although not the primary factor [17Berlin L. Communication of the significant but not urgent finding.Am J Roentgenol. 1997; 168: 329-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar]. This is the one area in medical malpractice litigation in which the physician can play the most important role in reducing risk and liability. Many courts have repeatedly held that the communication of a diagnosis, if it is to be beneficial, is sometimes as important as the diagnosis itself [18Phillips vs Good Samaritan Hospital, 416 NE 2d 646 (Ohio App 1979).Google Scholar]. This communication must be timely and appropriate and should be documented. Failure to document a communication is one of the major reasons why radiologists will lose lawsuits when failures to communicate are alleged. Radiologists who argue that their liability ends when they have correctly dictated reports will quickly find out that jurors will not agree. Although a correctly written report may have sufficed in the past, nonroutine communication may be necessary when findings suggest a need for immediate treatment or urgent intervention. This communication needs to be accomplished in a manner that will most likely reach the treating or referring physician. Even if the communication is in person or by telephone, confirm the receipt of that communication and document the conversation. The communication needs to be to the referring physician, or other health care provider, or even an appropriate representative. If that individual cannot be reached, there are times when communication may be directly to the patient or responsible guardian. Document all communications as to date, time, the person spoken to, and what was said. Under some circumstances, practice constraints may dictate the necessity of a preliminary report before the final report is prepared. Any significant change between the preliminary and final interpretation should be reported directly to the referring physician, and that communication should also be documented. The routine communication of the final written report will not suffice, because medical treatment may have already been instituted on your preliminary report. Nonroutine communication can be accomplished in person, or by telephone, fax, e-mail, personal digital assistant, and so on. Just document it! Unexpected findings are those that may seriously affect a patient\u2019s health but do not require immediate or urgent intervention. This is the one area in which radiologists have the most problems. Before 2002, the communication of unexpected findings had to be by direct communication, either in person or by telephone. The courts have consistently held that a radiologist cannot escape the duty to immediately communicate with a referring physician when urgent or life-threatening conditions are found. It is undisputed that urgent or life-threatening conditions need to be communicated directly to the referring physician. However, it is unclear what a radiologist actually needs to do when a finding is unexpected but not life threatening [14American College of RadiologyACR practice guideline for communication of diagnostic imaging findings.in: Practice guidelines and technical standards. American College of Radiology, Reston, Va2005: 5-9Google Scholar]. If the author of an interpretive report is not available to sign the report, a colleague will often sign the report, substituting their signature for the author\u2019s signature. There is a danger to signing a colleague\u2019s interpretive report because, if they are sued for malpractice, the person who signed the report will almost certainly be sued as well. If a physician signs a colleague\u2019s report, it should be done with the full understanding that that physician may be held responsible for the contents of the report [19Smith J.J. Berlin L. Signing a colleague\u2019s radiology report.Am J Roentgenol. 2001; 176: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar]. Radiologists should recognize the potential obligations of assuming the care and treatment of patients who present themselves for imaging studies on a self-referred or third-party basis, such as employment or insurance company physicals. This may require communicating the results directly to a patient if there is a serious finding. It may also include the necessity of appropriate follow-up. Again, documentation is strongly suggested. In a recent Arizona Supreme Court case, the court held that the radiologist had a duty to inform a patient of the results of chest radiography, even though she was referred by a nonphysician employer. The patient had been sent for preemployment chest radiography by a daycare center to rule out tuberculosis. The chest radiograph was read by the radiologist as showing a suspicious nodule, and the report was sent to the employer. The patient was never informed of the results by the employer or the radiologist. She was later diagnosed with lung cancer and alleged that the radiologist provided negligent and improper medical care by failing to diagnose or communicate the abnormality in an adequate or timely manner. Although the court held that the radiologist owed no duty, the decision was reversed on appeal to the appellate court, holding that he did owe a duty. The Arizona Supreme Court held that the lack of a formal physician-patient relationship does not remove medical professionals from their responsibility to tell what examinations reveal [20Stanley v McCarver, 92 P2d 849 (Ariz 2004).Google Scholar]. The Arizona Supreme Court somewhat diluted the appellate court\u2019s decision by holding that a radiologist must act reasonably in reading the radiographs and reporting the findings. This leaves it up to the jury to determine what is reasonable. However, the issue still remains very volatile for radiologists who deal with chiropractors and other nonmedical professionals or entities. When performing an independent medical examination, such as a review of imaging studies, a radiologist does not have the typical physician\u2019s responsibility to diagnose. For a medical malpractice claim to proceed forward, a physician-patient relationship needs to exist. If there is no physician-patient relationship, there is no basis for a medical malpractice claim. However, the Michigan Supreme Court recently ruled that an independent medical examiner may owe a limited duty to exercise professional care [21Dyer v Trachtman, 679 NW 2d 311 (Mich 2004).Google Scholar]. Even though this case involved an orthopedic surgeon who allegedly caused a partial rotator cuff tear to become complete during a vigorous physical examination, it shows how the courts are reaching out to establish a physician-patient relationship for third-party examinations. There has been a growing trend over the past 15 years to directly communicate with patients. Radiologists have been doing this for some time with mammographic reports under the federal Mammography Quality Standards Act of 1992. Radiologists who perform computed tomographic screening also directly communicate with patients. Furthermore, the ACR guideline for communication recommends that it be done for self-referred patients or third-party-referred patients. It is important to become familiar with the ACR practice guideline for communication and the ACR Appropriateness Criteria\u00ae. Adherence to the following recommendations will not prevent one from being sued, but it may reduce the risk for being sued and losing: \u2022Perception and interpretation can be improved with clinical information.\u2022Look at the imaging studies before reading prior reports.\u2022Directly communicate when immediate treatment or surgical intervention is needed or when there is a significant change between the preliminary and final reports.\u2022Nonroutine communication should be handled in a manner that gets the information to the referring physician.\u2022If in doubt as to whether to use routine communication, use nonroutine communication.\u2022If a physician signs a colleague\u2019s report, do so with the understanding that one may be held responsible for its contents.\u2022Be aware of potential obligations of self-referred patients and those referred on a third-party basis.\u2022Document all nonroutine communications as to date, time, who spoke, and what was said.\u2022Communicating significant abnormal findings in a timely manner is the one area in which one can make a significant change to reduce personal risk and liability."}, {"id":

The epidemiology of radiologically isolated syndrome remains largely unknown, and there are no population-based studies, to our knowledge. Our aim was to study the population-based incidence of radiologically isolated syndrome in a high-incidence region for MS and to evaluate the effect on radiologically isolated syndrome incidence when revising the original radiologically isolated syndrome criteria by using the latest radiologic classification for dissemination in space. <h3>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</h3> All 2272 brain MR imaging scans in 1907 persons obtained during 2013 in the Swedish county of V\u00e4stmanland, with a population of 259,000 inhabitants, were blindly evaluated by a senior radiologist and a senior neuroradiologist. The Okuda criteria for radiologically isolated syndrome were applied by using both the Barkhof and Swanton classifications for dissemination in space. Assessments of clinical data were performed by a radiology resident and a senior neurologist. <h3>RESULTS:</h3> The cumulative incidence of radiologically isolated syndrome was 2 patients (0.1%), equaling an incidence rate of 0.8 cases per 100,000 person-years, in a region with an incidence rate of MS of 10.2 cases per 100,000 person-years. There was no difference in the radiologically isolated syndrome incidence rate when applying a modified version of the Okuda criteria by using the newer Swanton classification for dissemination in space. <h3>CONCLUSIONS:</h3> Radiologically isolated syndrome is uncommon in a high-incidence region for MS. Adapting the Okuda criteria to use the dissemination in space\u2013Swanton classification may be feasible.

In terms of results, radiologic osteoarthritis is not associated with the type of injury according to the Hardcastle classification nor with having an open or closed fracture. The Hardcastle classification is not associated with the type of fixation used. Fractures fixed with a combination of plates and screws had a 3.01 (95% confidence interval 1.036 to 8.74) increased risk of having stage 3 or 4 radiologic osteoarthritis compared with being fixed solely with bridging plates (p = .009). Multivariate analysis revealed that this increased risk of osteoarthritis was dependent on the quality of reduction, with good reductions having a 18.2 (95% confidence interval 15.9 to 21.8) times decreased risk of severe osteoarthritis compared with fair or poor reductions, independent of the type of fixation used (p < .0001). No radiologic benefits were found when comparing plate or screw fixation for Lisfranc fracture dislocations (although screw fixation might be associated with a less planus foot and fewer complications). Instead, a good anatomic reduction was the only predictor of the radiologic outcome, and the Hardcastle classification of fractures did not predict the surgery type or radiologic outcome. Finally, treatment with combination plates and screws resulted in worse radiologic outcomes, possibly owing to more complex fracture patterns."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W1965229646", "relevance_score": 267.20035, "publication_year": 2003, "title": "Online Radiology Appropriateness Survey", "cited_by_count": 37, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Multiple choice", "level": 3, "score": 0.6268363}, {"display_name": "Medical education", "level": 1, "score": 0.5340478}, {"display_name": "Medical physics", "level": 1, "score": 0.46233508}, {"display_name": "House staff", "level": 2, "score": 0.4531796}, {"display_name": "Family medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.44315678}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.33664086}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"This": [0], "study": [1], "was": [2, 66, 86, 138], "performed": [3], "to": [4, 11, 80, 88, 155, 177, 182], "evaluate": [5], "the": [6, 28, 32, 49, 63, 76, 83, 98, 117, 125], "ability": [7], "of": [8, 31, 35, 93, 116, 124, 131, 170], "medical": [9, 89], "trainees": [10], "choose": [12, 156], "appropriate": [13, 157, 187], "diagnostic": [14], "imaging": [15, 158, 188], "studies": [16], "for": [17, 104, 109, 160], "patients": [18], "with": [19], "various": [20], "clinical": [21, 23], "indications.Twelve": [22], "scenarios": [24], "were": [25, 51, 58, 73, 102], "excerpted": [26], "from": [27], "2000": [29], "edition": [30], "American": [33], "College": [34], "Radiology": [36], "appropriateness": [37], "criteria": [38, 50], "and": [39, 55, 61, 107, 144], "arranged": [40], "in": [41, 82, 164, 185], "multiple-choice": [42], "question": [43], "format.": [44], "Summary": [45], "answers": [46, 72], "based": [47], "on": [48], "written.": [52], "The": [53, 100, 128], "questionnaire": [54], "answer": [56, 64], "key": [57, 65], "placed": [59], "online": [60, 84, 180], "linked;": [62], "viewable": [67], "only": [68], "after": [69], "all": [70, 105], "12": [71, 126], "submitted": [74], "by": [75, 135, 140, 145], "trainee.": [77], "An": [78], "invitation": [79], "participate": [81], "survey": [85], "forwarded": [87], "house": [90, 149], "staff.Sixty-five": [91], "(43.3%)": [92], "150": [94], "potential": [95], "respondents": [96, 106, 118], "completed": [97], "survey.": [99], "results": [101], "tabulated": [103], "separately": [108], "each": [110], "postgraduate-year": [111], "class.": [112], "Fewer": [113], "than": [114, 122], "50%": [115], "correctly": [119, 134], "answered": [120, 133], "more": [121], "half": [123], "questions.": [127], "average": [129], "number": [130], "questions": [132], "1st-year": [136], "residents": [137], "7.02;": [139], "2nd-year": [141], "residents,": [142, 147], "7.5;": [143], "3rd-year": [146], "7.9.Medical": [148], "staff": [150], "are": [151], "not": [152], "adequately": [153], "prepared": [154], "examinations": [159], "specific": [161], "indications.": [162], "Improvements": [163], "education": [165], "could": [166], "prevent": [167], "inappropriate": [168], "use": [169], "radiology": [171], "resources.": [172], "Imaging": [173], "centers": [174], "might": [175], "want": [176], "consider": [178], "developing": [179], "catalogs": [181], "assist": [183], "clinicians": [184], "choosing": [186], "tests.": [189]}, "authors": ["Benjamin H.

Noninvasive fungal disease includes localized fungal colonization, fungal ball, and allergic fungal rhinosinusitis. Noninvasive disease is simply fungal material (or the products of the inflammatory reaction of the sinus mucosa) that fills the sinuses but does not invade tissue. Bone loss is related to expansion of the sinus(es). Invasive disease causes tissue destruction, such that it expands past the bony confines of the sinuses.

Additional data analyzed included United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 board examination score (a proxy for academic performance), interview scores, and final position on rank list.Female applicants averaged 24% of the total applicant pool during the years studied, yet made up a disproportionately high percentage of applicants invited to interview (30%) and those ranked in top 25% (38%). It was found that female applicants had slightly higher mean interview scores and lower Step 1 scores than male applicants.Our findings suggest that program directors in one program want to increase gender diversity by making strides to keep the female candidate pool and the proportion of female residents in the program at least stable. The pipeline of female medical students pursuing a career in radiology appears to be a limiting factor rather than a bias against women in the resident selection process.

The natural course of the disorder in each group were observed for more than two years (range, two to 18 years; mean, five years). Of the 79 hips without collapse of the femoral heads (Stage II) at the beginning of follow-up evaluation, 42 femoral heads subsequently collapsed. These collapses took place predominantly in cases involving Types 1C, 2, and 3B. Conversely, the incidence of collapse was significantly low in the other groups (Types 1A, 1B, and 3A). Collapse of the femoral head occurred in 78 femoral heads of 115. The incidences of collapse by group was 0% for Type 1A, 19% for Type 1B, 94% for Type 1C, 100% for Type 2, 12% for Type 3A, and 100% for Type 3B.

Many AMEs have demonstrated benign behavior and are often cured with excision with negative margins, but some have exhibited malignant transformation of the myoepithelial cells, ductal epithelial cells, or both. When one of the components is histologically malignant, it is termed AME with carcinoma. Due to the rarity, the literature correlating imaging, histology, and clinical outcome is limited. A retrospective review was undertaken. A review of an institutional pathology database identified 14 cases with AME or malignant AME. Most AMEs had nonspecific imaging findings and were categorized as Bi-Rads 4. Histologic features of AME did not correlate with prior or concurrent breast malignancies or any radiographic features. Clinical follow up could be obtained for all but one case (mean follow up time = 75 months). 5 cases had no known treatment post-biopsy and 5 patients received mastectomy. No recurrences were noted. 3/13 cases of benign AME had associated breast malignancies including invasive ductal adenocarcinoma and ductal carcinoma in-situ. 1 case of malignant AME had a synchronous separate malignant phyllodes tumor. Given the unclear and unpredictable propensity for malignant transformation, conservative excision with negative margins currently seems appropriate."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W3006670485", "relevance_score": 191.60632, "publication_year": 2020, "title": "Integrating AI into radiology workflow: levels of research, production, and feedback maturity", "cited_by_count": 37, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Workflow", "level": 2, "score": 0.8492944}, {"display_name": "Automation", "level": 2, "score": 0.45740464}, {"display_name": "Artificial intelligence", "level": 1, "score": 0.44914678}, {"display_name": "Software deployment", "level": 2, "score": 0.43601853}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.41215047}, {"display_name": "Medical physics", "level": 1, "score": 0.3544132}, {"display_name": "Machine learning", "level": 1, "score": 0.32857594}, {"display_name": "Software engineering", "level": 1, "score": 0.22028723}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"We": [0], "present": [1], "a": [2, 134, 188], "roadmap": [3], "for": [4, 93, 99], "integrating": [5], "artificial": [6], "intelligence": [7], "(AI)-based": [8], "image": [9], "analysis": [10], "algorithms": [11], "into": [12], "existing": [13], "radiology": [14], "workflows": [15], "such": [16], "that": [17, 147], "(1)": [18, 54], "radiologists": [19, 63, 90], "can": [20], "significantly": [21, 152], "benefit": [22], "from": [23, 157, 169, 183], "enhanced": [24], "automation": [25], "in": [26, 79], "various": [27], "imaging": [28], "tasks": [29], "due": [30], "to": [31, 39, 75, 139, 171, 185], "AI,": [32], "and": [33, 83, 86], "(2)": [34, 69], "radiologists\u2019": [35], "feedback": [36, 88, 155], "is": [37, 46, 145], "utilized": [38], "further": [40], "improve": [41], "the": [42, 57, 72, 95, 103, 130, 140, 148, 159, 176], "AI": [43, 96, 105, 150], "application.": [44], "This": [45], "achieved": [47], "by": [48, 62], "establishing": [49], "three": [50], "maturity": [51, 142], "levels": [52], "where": [53], "research": [55], "enables": [56], "visualization": [58], "of": [59, 102, 112, 121, 133, 161, 178, 190], "AI-based": [60, 73, 113, 136], "results/annotations": [61], "without": [64], "generating": [65], "new": [66], "patient": [67, 174], "records;": [68], "production": [70], "allows": [71], "system": [74], "generate": [76], "results": [77, 98], "stored": [78], "an": [80], "institution\u2019s": [81], "picture-archiving": [82], "communication": [84], "system;": [85], "(3)": [87], "equips": [89], "with": [91, 124, 154, 175], "tools": [92], "editing": [94], "inference": [97], "periodic": [100], "retraining": [101], "deployed": [104], "systems,": [106], "thereby": [107], "allowing": [108], "continuous": [109], "organic": [110], "improvement": [111], "radiology-workflow": [114], "solutions.": [115], "A": [116], "case": [117], "study": [118], "(i.e.,": [119], "detection": [120], "brain": [122, 164], "metastases": [123, 165], "T1-weighted": [125], "contrast-enhanced": [126], "three-dimensional": [127], "MRI)": [128], "illustrates": [129], "deployment": [131], "details": [132], "particular": [135], "application": [137, 151], "according": [138], "aforementioned": [141], "levels.": [143], "It": [144], "shown": [146], "given": [149], "improves": [153], "coming": [156], "radiologists;": [158], "number": [160, 177], "incorrectly": [162], "detected": [163], "(false": [166], "positives)": [167], "decreases": [168], "14.2": [170], "9.12": [172], "per": [173], "subsequently": [179], "annotated": [180], "datasets": [181], "increasing": [182], "93": [184], "217": [186], "as": [187], "result": [189], "radiologist": [191], "adjudication.": [192]}, "authors": ["Engin Dikici", "Matthew T.

Good ratings were attained in 74% of Amipaque and 76% of Pantopaque examinations. Demonstration of nerve rootlets in the cauda equina and filling of lumbar root sleeves were superior with Amipaque. Amipaque more easily demonstrated the high posterior cervical subarachnoid space and the anterior and posterior margins of the cervical spinal cord. The incidence of postmyelographic headache was 38% with Amipaque and 32% with Pantopaque. Nausea and vomiting were more common with Amipaque. Two patients experienced grand mal seizures after examination with Amipaque.Article HistoryReceived: June 6 1978Accepted: July 31 1978Published in print: Dec 1978 FiguresReferencesRelatedDetailsCited ByNeurological Complications of Systemic Cancer and Antineoplastic TherapyKester A.Phillips, DavidSchiff2022Convective forces increase rostral delivery of intrathecal radiotracers and antisense oligonucleotides in the cynomolgus monkey nervous systemJenna M.Sullivan, CurtMazur, Daniel A.Wolf, LauraHorky, NicolasCurrier, BethanyFitzsimmons, JacobHesterman, RachelPauplis, ScottHaller, BeritPowers, LeighlaTayefeh, BeaDeBrosse-Serra, JackHoppin, HollyKordasiewicz, Eric E.Swayze, AjayVerma2020 | Journal of Translational Medicine, Vol. 18, No. 1MyelographyDonald B.Price, A.

Individual members of the Standards of Practice Committee dedicate the vast majority of professional time to diagnostic and interventional practice and the joint committee includes representatives from radiology, neurosurgery, interventional radiology and interventional neuroradiology, a diverse constituency expert on the subject matter under consideration.Technical documents specifying the exact consensus and literature review methodologies as well as the institutional affiliations and professional credentials of the authors of this document are available on request from SIR, 10201 Lee Highway, Suite 500, Fairfax, VA 22030.METHODOLOGYASITN, ASNR, and SIR Standards of Practice documents are produced using the following process. Standards documents of relevance and timeliness are conceptualized by the Standards of Practice Committee members. A recognized expert is identified to serve as the principal author for the standard. Additional authors may be assigned depending on the magnitude of the project.An in-depth literature search is performed with electronic medical literature data bases. Then a critical review and selection of peer-reviewed articles are performed based on study methodology, results, and conclusions. Data compiled from selected articles meeting evidence thresholds are used to develop content and to set standards.When the evidence of literature is weak, conflicting, or contradictory, consensus for the parameter is reached by a minimum of 12 Standards of Practice Committee members with a Modified Delphi Consensus Method (1Fink A Kosefcoff J Chassin M Brook RH Consensus methods: characteristics and guidelines for use.Am J Public Health. 1984; 74: 979-983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Leape LL Hilborne LH Park RE et al.The appropriateness of use of coronary artery bypass graft surgery in New York State.JAMA. 1993; 269: 753-760Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For purposes of these documents, consensus is defined as 80% Delphi participant agreement on a value or parameter.The draft document is critically reviewed by the Standards of Practice Committee members, either by telephone conference calling or face-to-face meeting. The finalized draft from the Committee is sent to the ASITN, ASNR, and SIR membership for further input/criticism during a 30-day comment period. These comments are discussed by the Standards of Practice Committee, and appropriate revisions made to create the finished standards document. Before its publication, the document was endorsed by the ASITN Executive Committee, ASNR Executive Committee, and the SIR Executive Council.I. INTRODUCTIONThis Quality Improvement Guideline for the Performance of Cervical Carotid Angioplasty and Stent Placement was developed by a writing group consisting of members from interventional neuroradiology, neurosurgery, neuroradiology, and interventional radiology. A thorough review of the literature was performed. Thresholds for quality assurance were difficult to set due to the relative paucity of data and lack of uniform reporting of clinical outcomes and complications. The ASITN, the ASNR, and the SIR recognize that brachiocephalic revascularization is undergoing rapid change in technology even as it is being increasingly adopted in clinical practice for the treatment of cerebrovascular pathologies (3Connors 3rd, JJ Seidenwurm D Wojak JC et al.Treatment of atherosclerotic disease at the cervical carotid bifurcation: Current status and review of the literature.AJNR Am J Neuroradiol. 2000; 21: 444-450PubMed Google Scholar). There is a critical need to encourage the development of procedures that may improve outcomes for patients with brachiocephalic and intracranial atherosclerotic stenoses. Furthermore, due to the implications concerning stroke prevention, the ASITN, ASNR, and SIR wish to encourage the careful and scientific study of the safety and efficacy of brachiocephalic revascularization as well as appropriate utilization of these techniques (3Connors 3rd, JJ Seidenwurm D Wojak JC et al.Treatment of atherosclerotic disease at the cervical carotid bifurcation: Current status and review of the literature.AJNR Am J Neuroradiol. 2000; 21: 444-450PubMed Google Scholar).The published standard of practice for cervicocerebral angiography describes the minimum acceptable requirements for performance of the much less difficult and lower risk procedure of diagnostic cervicocerebral angiography (4American College of RadiologyStandard for the performance of diagnostic cervicocerebral angiography in adults.in: American College of Radiology Standards 2000\u20132001. American College of Radiology, Reston, VA2000: 415-426Google Scholar); it is the purpose of this standard to describe the minimum prerequisite for the performance of the far more difficult and higher risk procedure of carotid artery angioplasty and stent placement (CAS). Far more experience and training and fewer complications during diagnostic cerebral angiography are expected of those who perform neurovascular interventions, similar to what is expected of those who perform coronary interventions. At a minimum, performance of CAS requires extensive prior experience and demonstrated competence with diagnostic cervicocerebral angiography, as well as experience with angioplasty and stent placement. Such requirements for additional training and experience in performing CAS have been recognized by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) as part of the specialty training requirements for endovascular surgical neuroradiology (5Higashida RT Hopkins LN Berenstein A et al.Program requirements for Residency Fellowship Education in Neuroendovascular Surgery/Interventional Neuroradiology: A Special Report on Graduate Medical Education.AJNR. 2000; 21: 1153-1159PubMed Google Scholar).Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States, and ischemic stroke accounts for more than 80% of the morbidity and mortality associated with stroke. Many ischemic strokes are related to large- and medium-vessel atherosclerotic disease within the cerebrovascular circulation. Therefore, procedures such as angioplasty and/or stent placement to reverse critical cerebrovascular stenoses may have great importance. CAS is being performed with rapidly increasing frequency in the United States. We anticipate that more data regarding outcomes and complications will be collected and published in the near future (the National Institutes of Health\u2013supported Carotid Revascularization: Endarterectomy vs. Stent Trial [CREST] as well as other controlled series have begun) (6Roubin GS Hobson 2nd, RW White R et al.CREST and CARESS to evaluate carotid stenting: time to get to work!.J Endovasc Therapy. 2001; 8: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Therefore, we recommend that this standard be reviewed and, if necessary, revised within the next 24 months to remain applicable to contemporary medicine concerning this rapidly progressing technique.CAS is an innovative procedure. Until the true risks and appropriate indications for this procedure are clearly known, the ASITN, ASNR, and SIR recommend that for patients who have average surgical risk, such as those who would have qualified for enrollment in the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) and the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS), CAS should only be performed as part of a randomized clinical trial or an institutional review board\u2013approved investigational program. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the NASCET and ACAS studies are summarized in Table 1. At this time, CAS has shown promise for the treatment of patients known to be at high risk of carotid endarterectomy (Yadav J, presented at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions, Chicago, November 2002) (5Higashida RT Hopkins LN Berenstein A et al.Program requirements for Residency Fellowship Education in Neuroendovascular Surgery/Interventional Neuroradiology: A Special Report on Graduate Medical Education.AJNR. 2000; 21: 1153-1159PubMed Google Scholar). CAS should only be performed on appropriate patients by an individual or team with training and expertise in cerebrovascular angiography, pathophysiology, hemodynamics, and neurovascular interventions and/or carotid angioplasty/stent placement (7Veith FJ Amor M Ohki T et al.Current status of carotid bifurcation angioplasty and stenting based on a consensus of opinion leaders.J Vasc Surg. 2001; 33: S111-S116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This recommendation is further extended to encourage multidisciplinary input and concurring opinion in clinical decision making.Table 1Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria for Carotid Endarterectomy TrialsNASCET [9]InclusionSymptoms of focal cerebral ischemia ipsilateral to a stenosis of <70% (moderate group) or \u226570% (severe group) within 180 days, as shown on angiographySymptoms lasting <24 hours or producing nondisabling stroke (Rankin score <3)ExclusionAge >80 years (initial phase of moderate and severe stenosis; continuing study of moderate stenosis included these patients)Lack of angiographic visualization of symptomatic arteryLack of informed consentIntracranial stenosis more severe than the cervical stenosisOther disease limiting life expectancy to <5 yearsCerebral infarction limiting useful function in the affected arterial territoryNonatherosclerotic carotid diseaseCardiac lesions likely to cause cardioembolismHistory of ipsilateral carotid endarterectomyACAS [8]InclusionAge 40\u201379 yearsCompatible history and findings on physical and neurologic examinationAcceptable laboratory and electrocardiogram resultsArteriography within the previous 60 days indicating stenosis of at least 60% reduction in diameter (if arteriography performed 61\u2013364 days before randomization, repeat Doppler showing artery still patent) or Doppler examination within 60 days showing a frequency or velocity greater than the instrument-specific cut point with 95% positive predictive value or Doppler examination showing a frequency or velocity greater than the instrument-specific 90% positive predictive value cut point confirmed by ocular pneumoplethysmographic examination within the previous 60 daysExclusionCerebrovascular event in the distribution of the affected carotid artery or the vertebrobasilar systemSymptoms referable to the contralateral cerebral hemisphere within the previous 45 daysContraindication to aspirin therapyAny disorder that could seriously complicate surgeryAny condition that could prevent continuing participation or likely to produce death or disability within 5 yearsLack of informed consent Open table in a new tab II. OVERVIEWA. Rationale for Carotid EndarterectomyTwo large randomized studies, NASCET and ACAS, have established that certain selected patients benefit from surgical treatment of significant atherosclerotic stenosis in the cervical carotid artery (8Executive Committee for the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis StudyEndarterectomy for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis.JAMA. 1995; 273: 1421-1428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial CollaboratorsBeneficial effect of carotid endarterectomy in symptomatic patient with high-grade carotid stenosis.N Engl J Med. 1991; 325: 445-508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Rothwell PM Eliasziw M Gutnikov SA et al.for the Carotid Endarterectomy Trialists' CollaborationAnalysis of pooled data from the randomised controlled trials of endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis.Lancet. 2003; 361: 107-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar), whereas at least two other randomized studies of endarterectomy for asymptomatic carotid stenosis indicated no benefit from surgery (11Hobson II, RW Weiss DG Fields WS et al.Efficacy of carotid endarterectomy for asymptomatic carotid stenosis. The Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study Group.N Engl J Med. 1993; 328: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar, 12Mayo Asymptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Study GroupResults of a randomized controlled trial of carotid endarterectomy for asymptomatic carotid stenosis.Mayo Clin Proc. 1992; 67: 513-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NASCET and ACAS showed that lowered stroke morbidity can be achieved in selected symptomatic and asymptomatic patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) compared with aspirin therapy if surgical endarterectomy can be performed with an acceptably low complication rate. However, they did not evaluate the risk of endarterectomy versus \u201cbest\u201d medical therapy that is now currently available. No trial has evaluated the natural history or risk of stroke from cervical carotid atherosclerotic stenosis treated with warfarin, combination warfarin and aspirin, aspirin and dipyridamole, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, or combinations of antiplatelet agents. More importantly, newer drugs such as statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been proved to stabilize plaque and thus decrease myocardial infarction risk as well as lower stroke risk (13Golledge J Greenhalgh RM Davies AH The symptomatic carotid plaque.Stroke. 2000; 31: 774-781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Gorelick PB New horizons for stroke prevention. PROGRESS and HOPE.Lancet Neurol. 2002; 1: 149-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).The NASCET and ACAS studies must also be judged using the qualifications of the inclusion and exclusion criteria designed to select their study populations. These studies did not establish safety and efficacy for CEA versus aspirin therapy for the majority of patients with carotid artery stenosis screened at that time. For example, NASCET randomized only those patients with symptomatic events occurring within 120 days of surgery. Patients were excluded from this study if they had a coexistent tandem lesion that was more severe than the proximal internal carotid artery lesion, if they had particular renal, liver, or lung diseases, if they had coexistent cardiac disease that resulted in a valvular or rhythm disorder, or if they had undergone a previous ipsilateral CEA. Initially, patients were also not included in the study if they were 80 years of age or older. These factors resulted in NASCET actually enrolling fewer than one-half of the potential patients, and a large portion of current candidates for CEA would be excluded from this trial. NASCET did demonstrate that surgery was beneficial for these carefully selected symptomatic patients with more than 70% carotid stenosis (with specific measurement criteria used) and some with more than 50% (9North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial CollaboratorsBeneficial effect of carotid endarterectomy in symptomatic patient with high-grade carotid stenosis.N Engl J Med. 1991; 325: 445-508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Barnett HJ Taylor DW Eliasziw M et al.Benefit of carotid endarterectomy in patients with symptomatic moderate or severe stenosis.N Engl J Med. 1998; 339: 1468-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, ACAS exclusion criteria for asymptomatic patients were similar to those of NASCET, which resulted in actual randomization of fewer than 10% of all screened asymptomatic patients. However, in the United States, a large percentage of CEAs is performed on exactly these patients.CEA has a durable result, with reported restenosis rates ranging from approximately 5% to 20%, and with late stroke rates reported as less than 5% in 5 years (16Moore WS Kempczinski RF Nelson JJ Toole JF Recurrent carotid stenosis: results of the asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis study.Stroke. 1998; 29: 2018-2025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sundt Jr, TM Whisnant JP Houser OW Fode NC Prospective study of the effectiveness and durability of carotid endarterectomy.Mayo Clin Proc. 1990; 65: 625-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, current data indicate that CEA as it is currently practiced bears little resemblance to the populations studied, methods used, or results obtained in NASCET and the ACAS studies (18Chaturverdi S Aggarwal R Murugappan A Results of carotid endarterectomy with prospective neurologist follow-up.Neurology. 2000; 55: 769-772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Barnett HJM Broderick P Carotid endarterectomy: another wake-up call.Neurology. 2000; 55: 746-747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Wennberg DE Lucas FL Birkmeyer JD et al.Variation in carotid endarterectomy mortality in the Medicare population: trial hospitals, volume, and patient characteristics.JAMA. 1998; 279: 1278-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 21Wong JH Findlay JM Suarez-Almazoor ME Regional performance of carotid endarterectomy: Appropriateness, outcomes, and risk factors for complications.Stroke. 1997; 28: 891-898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recent evaluation of typical clinical practice indicates a significantly higher perioperative death rate for Medicare patients undergoing CEA at the same institutions participating in the NASCET and/or ACAS studies than for the original study patients (0.6% for NASCET patients, 0.1% for ACAS patients, but 1.4% for all Medicare patients) (20Wennberg DE Lucas FL Birkmeyer JD et al.Variation in carotid endarterectomy mortality in the Medicare population: trial hospitals, volume, and patient characteristics.JAMA. 1998; 279: 1278-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The perioperative mortality rate for Medicare patients undergoing CEA at nonstudy sites was 1.7% for high-volume institutions, 1.9% for average-volume institutions, and 2.5% for low-volume institutions (as opposed to 0.6% for NASCET and 0.1% for ACAS) (20Wennberg DE Lucas FL Birkmeyer JD et al.Variation in carotid endarterectomy mortality in the Medicare population: trial hospitals, volume, and patient characteristics.JAMA. 1998; 279: 1278-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Thus, the mortality rate was far higher at all institutions, including high-volume institutions and original trial sites, when unselected Medicare patients were considered. This may be partially explained by the fact that the patients participating in the NASCET and ACAS trials were younger and healthier than the typical Medicare patients now undergoing CEA at these same or other institutions. Older patients and those with significant comorbidity have repeatedly been shown to be at increased risk of perioperative stroke and death from CEA (20Wennberg DE Lucas FL Birkmeyer JD et al.Variation in carotid endarterectomy mortality in the Medicare population: trial hospitals, volume, and patient characteristics.JAMA. 1998; 279: 1278-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 21Wong JH Findlay JM Suarez-Almazoor ME Regional performance of carotid endarterectomy: Appropriateness, outcomes, and risk factors for complications.Stroke. 1997; 28: 891-898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sundt Jr, TM Sandok BA Whisnant JP Carotid endarterectomy: complications and preoperative assessment of risk.Mayo Clin Proc. 1975; 50: 301-306PubMed Google Scholar, 23Brook RH Park RE Chassin MR et al.Carotid endarterectomy for elderly patients: predicting complications.Ann Intern Med. 1990; 113: 747-753Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Paciaroni M Eliasziw M Kappelle LJ et al.Medical complications associated with carotid endarterectomy.

large language model with great potential as a tool in medical practice and education, but its performance in radiology remains unclear. Purpose To assess the performance of ChatGPT on radiology board-style examination questions without images and to explore its strengths and limitations. Materials and Methods In this exploratory prospective study performed from February 25 to March 3, 2023, 150 multiple-choice questions designed to match the style, content, and difficulty of the Canadian Royal College and American Board of Radiology examinations were grouped by question type (lower-order [recall, understanding] and higher-order [apply, analyze, synthesize] thinking) and topic (physics, clinical). The higher-order thinking questions were further subclassified by type (description of imaging findings, clinical management, application of concepts, calculation and classification, disease associations). ChatGPT performance was evaluated overall, by question type, and by topic. Confidence of language in responses was assessed. Univariable analysis was performed. Results ChatGPT answered 69% of questions correctly (104 of 150). The model performed better on questions requiring lower-order thinking (84%, 51 of 61) than on those requiring higher-order thinking (60%, 53 of 89) (P = .002). When compared with lower-order questions, the model performed worse on questions involving description of imaging findings (61%, 28 of 46; P = .04), calculation and classification (25%, two of eight; P = .01), and application of concepts (30%, three of 10; P = .01). ChatGPT performed as well on higher-order clinical management questions (89%, 16 of 18) as on lower-order questions (P = .88). It performed worse on physics questions (40%, six of 15) than on clinical questions (73%, 98 of 135) (P = .02). ChatGPT used confident language consistently, even when incorrect (100%, 46 of 46). Conclusion Despite no radiology-specific pretraining, ChatGPT nearly passed a radiology board-style examination without images; it performed well on lower-order thinking questions and clinical management questions but struggled with higher-order thinking questions involving description of imaging findings, calculation and classification, and application of concepts. \u00a9 RSNA, 2023 See also the editorial by Lourenco et al and the article by Bhayana et al in this issue."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2153609337", "relevance_score": 261.10754, "publication_year": 2002, "title": "Radiologic Manifestations of Proximal-Type Epithelioid Sarcoma of the Soft Tissues", "cited_by_count": 36, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Epithelioid sarcoma", "level": 3, "score": 0.95081043}, {"display_name": "Soft tissue", "level": 2, "score": 0.7013854}, {"display_name": "Thigh", "level": 2, "score": 0.6761755}, {"display_name": "Sarcoma", "level": 2, "score": 0.6635574}, {"display_name": "Perineum", "level": 2, "score": 0.4856016}, {"display_name": "Metastasis", "level": 3, "score": 0.47624257}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.4650769}, {"display_name": "Pathology", "level": 1, "score": 0.44891107}, {"display_name": "Soft tissue sarcoma", "level": 3, "score": 0.4425897}, {"display_name": "Anatomy", "level": 1, "score": 0.23940408}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Our": [0], "study": [1], "was": [2, 60], "conducted": [3], "to": [4], "summarize": [5], "the": [6, 34, 39, 48, 73], "clinical": [7], "and": [8, 11, 31, 64, 67, 89], "radiologic": [9], "presentations": [10], "imaging": [12, 66, 97], "features": [13], "of": [14, 38, 47, 54, 72], "proximal-type": [15, 82], "epithelioid": [16, 83], "sarcoma,": [17, 22], "a": [18, 86], "rare": [19], "aggressive": [20], "soft-tissue": [21], "in": [23, 45, 70], "16": [24], "patients.The": [25], "chest": [26], "wall,": [27], "inguinal": [28], "region,": [29], "thigh,": [30], "perineum": [32], "were": [33], "most": [35], "common": [36], "sites": [37], "disease.": [40], "Tumors": [41], "exhibited": [42], "multilobulated": [43], "contours": [44], "87.5%": [46], "patients,": [49], "which": [50], "may": [51], "be": [52], "suggestive": [53], "this": [55], "tumor": [56], "type.": [57], "Nodal": [58], "involvement": [59], "identified": [61], "on": [62, 96], "CT": [63, 76], "MR": [65, 78], "confirmed": [68], "pathologically": [69], "62.5%": [71], "patients.": [74], "Although": [75], "or": [77], "findings": [79], "are": [80], "nonspecific,": [81], "sarcoma": [84], "shows": [85], "multinodular": [87], "configuration": [88], "admixes": [90], "with": [91], "regional": [92], "lymph": [93], "node": [94], "metastasis": [95], "studies.": [98]}, "authors": ["Ukihide Tateishi", "Tadashi Hasegawa", "Masahiko Kusumoto", "R Yokoyama", "Noriyuki Moriyama"], "abstract": "Our study was conducted to summarize the clinical and radiologic presentations and imaging features of proximal-type epithelioid sarcoma, a rare aggressive soft-tissue sarcoma, in 16 patients.The chest wall, inguinal region, thigh, and perineum were the most common sites of the disease.

This paper proposes a deep learning model to automatically generate radiology reports given a chest x-ray image from the public IU-Xray dataset. Our work consists of three stages: (1) Fine-tune a pre-trained Chexnet to predict specific tags from the image. (2) Calculate weighted semantic features from the predicted tag's pre-trained embeddings. (3) Condition a pre-trained GPT2 model on the visual and semantic features to generate the full medical reports. We analyze the generated reports using word-overlap metrics while also adding new meaningful semantic-based similarity metrics. The proposed model, which we call CDGPT2, surpassed most non-hierarchical recurrent models and transformer-based models in quantitative metrics while being considerably faster to train. Moreover, the model does not require a specific vocabulary and can be trained on different datasets without changing the architecture. Furthermore, we include a qualitative analysis from a radiologist from Egypt's national institute of cancer which showed that 61.6% of the generated reports on the test set were expertly written, and only 10% contained false information. We represent the first work to condition a pre-trained transformer on visual and semantic features to generate medical reports and to include semantic similarity metrics in the quantitative analysis of the generated reports."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2041762404", "relevance_score": 231.3383, "publication_year": 2008, "title": "Identification of Sex Depending on Radiological Examination of Foot and Patella", "cited_by_count": 36, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Patella", "level": 2, "score": 0.7911984}, {"display_name": "Calcaneus", "level": 2, "score": 0.7525947}, {"display_name": "Foot (prosody)", "level": 2, "score": 0.6552022}, {"display_name": "Radiography", "level": 2, "score": 0.5852803}, {"display_name": "Metatarsal bones", "level": 2, "score": 0.5780174}, {"display_name": "Forensic anthropology", "level": 2, "score": 0.5403962}, {"display_name": "Orthodontics", "level": 1, "score": 0.53436834}, {"display_name": "Population", "level": 2, "score": 0.44699562}, {"display_name": "Discriminant function analysis", "level": 2, "score": 0.4287883}, {"display_name": "Anatomy", "level": 1, "score": 0.36945617}, {"display_name": "Surgery", "level": 1, "score": 0.2687819}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Forensic": [0], "anthropology": [1], "involves": [2], "the": [3, 59, 71, 96, 123, 172, 180, 215, 220, 238, 261], "building": [4], "of": [5, 9, 73, 75, 85, 95, 126, 143, 163, 167, 182, 214, 223, 229, 237, 247, 257, 268], "an": [6, 10], "antemortem": [7], "profile": [8], "individual": [11], "from": [12, 77], "skeletal": [13], "remains.": [14], "This": [15], "includes": [16], "sex,": [17], "race": [18], "determination,": [19], "and": [20, 22, 62, 92, 99, 107, 113, 137, 140, 147, 157, 165, 212, 241, 245, 250], "age": [21], "stature": [23], "estimation.": [24], "Because": [25], "most": [26], "bones": [27, 52, 145, 201, 244], "that": [28, 53, 188], "are": [29, 35, 54], "conventionally": [30], "used": [31, 151, 170], "for": [32], "sex": [33, 76, 154, 190, 225], "determination": [34, 226], "often": [36, 55], "recovered": [37, 56], "either": [38], "in": [39, 171], "a": [40, 82, 265], "fragmented": [41], "or": [42], "incomplete": [43], "state,": [44], "it": [45], "has": [46], "become": [47], "necessary": [48], "to": [49, 69, 118, 122, 152, 178], "use": [50], "denser": [51], "intact,": [57], "eg,": [58], "patella,": [60], "calcaneus,": [61], "talus.": [63], "The": [64, 185, 232], "present": [65], "work": [66], "was": [67], "performed": [68], "investigate": [70], "possibility": [72], "estimation": [74], "some": [78], "radiologic": [79], "measurements": [80, 131, 142, 197], "among": [81], "known": [83], "cross-section": [84], "Egyptian": [86], "population.": [87], "In": [88], "this": [89, 183], "study": [90, 186], "lateral": [91], "anteroposterior": [93], "radiographs": [94, 162], "right": [97, 133], "foot": [98, 164], "knee": [100], "were": [101, 150, 175, 192], "made": [102], "on": [103, 132, 195, 199, 204, 260], "160": [104], "living": [105], "unfractured": [106], "nonpathologic": [108], "individuals": [109, 168], "comprising": [110], "80": [111, 114], "males": [112], "females": [115], "aged": [116], "25": [117], "65": [119], "years": [120], "referred": [121], "Radiology": [124], "Department": [125], "Assiut": [127], "University": [128], "Hospital.": [129], "Two": [130], "patella": [134, 166], "(maximum": [135], "height": [136], "maximum": [138], "width)": [139], "2": [141, 209], "metatarsal": [144, 200, 217, 243, 252], "(length": [146, 211], "midshaft": [148, 246], "diameter),": [149], "determine": [153], "by": [155], "univariate": [156], "multivariate": [158, 233, 258], "discriminant": [159], "analysis.": [160], "Eighty": [161], "not": [169], "original": [173], "sample": [174, 263], "randomly": [176], "selected": [177], "test": [179], "accuracy": [181], "method.": [184], "revealed": [187, 264], "significant": [189], "differences": [191], "demonstrated": [193], "based": [194], "these": [196], "taken": [198], "more": [202], "than": [203], "patella.": [205], "One": [206], "function": [207, 234, 259], "associating": [208, 235], "parameters": [210], "midshaft)": [213], "third": [216], "bone": [218], "obtained": [219], "highest": [221], "value": [222], "correct": [224, 266], "with": [227], "rate": [228], "100%": [230, 254], "accuracy.": [231, 255], "length": [236], "first,": [239, 248], "third,": [240], "fifth": [242, 251], "second,": [249], "gave": [253], "Test": [256], "independent": [262], "classification": [267], "87.5%.": [269]}, "authors": ["Wafaa M.

Because most bones that are conventionally used for sex determination are often recovered either in a fragmented or incomplete state, it has become necessary to use denser bones that are often recovered intact, eg, the patella, calcaneus, and talus. The present work was performed to investigate the possibility of estimation of sex from some radiologic measurements among a known cross-section of Egyptian population. In this study lateral and anteroposterior radiographs of the right foot and knee were made on 160 living unfractured and nonpathologic individuals comprising 80 males and 80 females aged 25 to 65 years referred to the Radiology Department of Assiut University Hospital. Two measurements on right patella (maximum height and maximum width) and 2 measurements of metatarsal bones (length and midshaft diameter), were used to determine sex by univariate and multivariate discriminant analysis. Eighty radiographs of foot and patella of individuals not used in the original sample were randomly selected to test the accuracy of this method. The study revealed that significant sex differences were demonstrated based on these measurements taken on metatarsal bones more than on patella. One function associating 2 parameters (length and midshaft) of the third metatarsal bone obtained the highest value of correct sex determination with rate of 100% accuracy. The multivariate function associating length of the first, third, and fifth metatarsal bones and midshaft of first, second, and fifth metatarsal gave 100% accuracy.

This study investigates the bottom\u2010up effects of three types of images on viewing patterns of students, residents and radiologists: focal diseases (localized abnormality), diffuse diseases (distributed abnormality) and images showing no abnormalities (normal). Participants inspected conventional chest radiographs while their eye movements were recorded. Regardless of expertise, in focal diseases, participants fixated relatively long at specific locations, whereas in diffuse diseases, fixations were more dispersed and shorter. Moreover, for students, dispersion of fixations was higher on diffuse compared with normal images, whereas for residents and radiologists, dispersion was highest on normal images. Despite this difference, students showed relatively high performance on normal images but low performance on focal and diffuse images.

Although viewing behavior of students was similar to that of radiologists, they lack knowledge that helps them diagnose the disease correctly.

However, comprehensive results of DLIF have not been reported in Korea yet. The object of this study is to summarize radiological and clinical outcomes of our DLIF experience. Methods We performed DLIF for 130 patients from May 2011 to June 2013. Among them, 90 patients, who could be followed up for more than 6 months, were analyzed retrospectively. Clinical outcomes were compared using visual analog scale (VAS) score and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Bilateral foramen areas, disc height, segmental coronal and sagittal angle, and regional sagittal angle were measured. Additionally, fusion rate was assessed. Results A total of 90 patients, 116 levels, were underwent DLIF. The VAS and ODI improved statistically significant after surgery. All the approaches for DLIF were done on the left side. The left and right side foramen area changed from 99.5 mm2 and 102.9 mm2 to 159.2 mm2 and 151.2 mm2 postoperatively (p<0.001). Pre- and postoperative segmental coronal and sagittal angles changed statistically significant from 4.1\u00c2\u00b0 and 9.9\u00c2\u00b0 to 1.1\u00c2\u00b0 and 11.1\u00c2\u00b0. Fusion rates of 6 and 12 months were 60.9% and 87.8%. Complications occurred in 17 patients (18.9%). However, most of the complications were resolved within 2 months. Conclusion DLIF is not only effective for indirect decompression and deformity correction but also shows satisfactory mechanical stability and fusion rate.

Clinical ML systems must be interpretable to ensure user trust. To create interpretable models applicable to all of these tasks, we can build general-purpose systems which extract all relevant human-level assertions or \u201cfacts\u201d documented in reports; identifying these facts is an information extraction (IE) task. Previous IE work in radiology has focused on a limited set of information, and extracts isolated entities (i.e., single words such as \u201clesion\u201d or \u201ccyst\u201d) rather than complete facts, which require the linking of multiple entities and modifiers. Here, we develop a prototype system to extract all useful information in abdominopelvic radiology reports (findings, recommendations, clinical history, procedures, imaging indications and limitations, etc.), in the form of complete, contextualized facts. We construct an information schema to capture the bulk of information in reports, develop real-time ML models to extract this information, and demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the system."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W1542164597", "relevance_score": 210.94778, "publication_year": 2005, "title": "Radiological Findings and Clinical Results of 102 Thrust-Plate Femoral Hip Prostheses", "cited_by_count": 36, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Radiological weapon", "level": 2, "score": 0.73846006}, {"display_name": "Prosthesis", "level": 2, "score": 0.6699047}, {"display_name": "Surgery", "level": 1, "score": 0.63476264}, {"display_name": "Femoral neck", "level": 3, "score": 0.44450873}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"We": [0], "report": [1], "the": [2, 21, 25, 63, 99, 103, 107, 121, 125, 132, 156, 179, 182], "radiological": [3], "and": [4, 48, 86, 89, 138], "clinical": [5, 96], "outcome": [6], "of": [7, 24, 32, 34, 45, 51, 60, 62, 115, 124, 131, 168, 181], "102": [8], "consecutive": [9], "femoral": [10, 64], "hip": [11, 144], "arthroplasty": [12], "we": [13], "prospectively": [14], "followed": [15], "up": [16, 177], "in": [17, 68, 90], "84": [18], "patients": [19], "using": [20], "third": [22], "generation": [23], "thrust-plate": [26, 55], "prosthesis": [27], "with": [28, 120, 173], "a": [29, 110, 129, 165], "mean": [30], "period": [31], "follow-up": [33, 184], "58": [35], "(range,": [36], "26-100)": [37], "months.": [38], "Four": [39], "implants": [40], "were": [41, 72], "revised:": [42], "2": [43, 49], "because": [44, 50], "an": [46], "infection": [47], "aseptic": [52], "loosening.": [53], "The": [54, 113, 141], "prosthesis,": [56], "which": [57], "allows": [58], "preservation": [59], "part": [61], "neck,": [65], "was": [66, 81], "used": [67], "younger": [69, 73], "patients,": [70], "80%": [71], "than": [74], "60": [75], "years.": [76], "In": [77], "95": [78], "implants,": [79], "contact": [80, 119], "maintained": [82], "between": [83], "thrust": [84, 104, 126], "plate": [85, 105], "underlying": [87], "bone,": [88], "only": [91], "3": [92], "instances,": [93], "without": [94], "any": [95], "manifestation,": [97], "did": [98], "bone": [100, 118, 133], "retract": [101], "from": [102, 147], "to": [106, 151, 162, 178], "extent": [108, 114], "that": [109], "gap": [111], "appeared.": [112], "radiologically": [116], "evident": [117], "flat": [122], "surface": [123], "plate,": [127], "as": [128], "consequence": [130], "remodeling": [134], "behavior,": [135], "is": [136], "described": [137], "retrospectively": [139], "classified.": [140], "average": [142], "Harris": [143], "score": [145], "increased": [146], "51": [148], "points": [149, 153], "preoperatively": [150], "96": [152], "postoperatively": [154], "at": [155], "last": [157], "follow-up.": [158], "Survivorship": [159], "analysis": [160], "according": [161], "Kaplan-Meier": [163], "showed": [164], "survival": [166], "rate": [167], "98%": [169], "after": [170], "6": [171], "years,": [172], "no": [174], "further": [175], "losses": [176], "end": [180], "8-year": [183], "period.": [185]}, "authors": ["Martin L.

Four implants were revised: 2 because of an infection and 2 because of aseptic loosening. The thrust-plate prosthesis, which allows preservation of part of the femoral neck, was used in younger patients, 80% were younger than 60 years. In 95 implants, contact was maintained between thrust plate and underlying bone, and in only 3 instances, without any clinical manifestation, did the bone retract from the thrust plate to the extent that a gap appeared.

Materials and Methods Full and partial Bayesian regression models were applied to data from two studies (n = 180 and 100, respectively): (a) The diagnostic value of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels (outcome variable) for predicting disease after radical prostatectomy (gold standard) was evaluated for three risk groups (covariates) based on Gleason scores. (b) Spiral computed tomography was performed on patients with proved obstructing ureteral stones. The predictive value of stone size (outcome) was evaluated along with two treatment options (gold standard), as well as stone location (in or not in the ureterovesical junction [UVJ]) and patient age (covariates). Summary ROC measures were reported, and various prior distributions of the regression coefficients were investigated. Results (a) In the PSA example, the ROC areas under the full model were 0.667, 0.769, and 0.703, respectively, for the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups. Under the partial model, the area beneath the ROC curve was 0.706. (b) The ROC areas for patients with ureteral stones in the UVJ decreased dramatically with age but otherwise were close to that under the partial model (ie, 0.774). The prior distribution had greater influence in the second example. Conclusion The diagnostic tests were accurate in both examples. PSA levels were most accurate for staging prostate cancer among intermediate-risk patients. Stone size was predictive of treatment option for all patients other than those 40 years or older and with a stone in the UVJ."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W1991309853", "relevance_score": 204.04874, "publication_year": 2013, "title": "Petrous apex cholesterol granuloma: pictorial review of radiological considerations in diagnosis and surgical histopathology", "cited_by_count": 36, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Differential diagnosis", "level": 2, "score": 0.7792226}, {"display_name": "Radiological weapon", "level": 2, "score": 0.7700933}, {"display_name": "Histopathology", "level": 2, "score": 0.61385477}, {"display_name": "Granuloma", "level": 2, "score": 0.5911342}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.5704743}, {"display_name": "Pathology", "level": 1, "score": 0.32988888}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Petrous": [0], "apex": [1, 62, 97, 133], "cholesterol": [2, 9, 63, 98, 134], "granulomas": [3], "are": [4, 100], "expansile,": [5], "cystic": [6], "lesions": [7], "containing": [8], "crystals": [10], "surrounded": [11], "by": [12], "foreign": [13], "body": [14], "giant": [15], "cells,": [16], "fibrous": [17], "tissue": [18], "reaction": [19], "and": [20, 31, 65, 79, 105, 116, 157], "chronic": [21], "inflammation.": [22], "Appropriate": [23], "treatment": [24], "relies": [25], "on": [26], "an": [27, 32], "accurate": [28], "radiological": [29, 37, 58, 80, 104, 117], "diagnosis": [30, 45, 94, 130], "understanding": [33], "of": [34, 39, 46, 55, 60, 86, 95, 123, 131, 145, 161], "the": [35, 43, 56, 71, 77, 92, 121, 124, 149, 159], "distinguishing": [36], "features": [38, 59, 68, 89, 107], "relevant": [40, 57, 69, 90, 108], "entities": [41], "in": [42, 138, 148], "differential": [44, 72, 93], "this": [47, 49], "condition.Firstly,": [48], "paper": [50], "presents": [51], "a": [52, 146], "pictorial": [53], "review": [54], "petrous": [61, 96, 132], "granuloma,": [64], "highlights": [66], "unique": [67], "to": [70, 91, 109, 140, 154], "diagnosis.": [73], "Secondly,": [74], "it": [75], "reviews": [76], "histopathological": [78, 106, 115], "findings": [81], "associated": [82], "with": [83, 103], "surgical": [84, 110, 113, 125], "drainage": [85, 126, 150], "these": [87], "lesions.Radiological": [88], "granuloma": [99, 135], "reviewed,": [101], "together": [102], "management.": [111], "Following": [112], "management,": [114], "evidence": [118], "demonstrates": [119], "that": [120], "patency": [122, 156], "pathway": [127, 151], "is": [128, 136], "maintained.Accurate": [129], "essential": [137], "order": [139], "instigate": [141], "appropriate": [142], "treatment.": [143], "Placement": [144], "stent": [147], "may": [152], "help": [153], "maintain": [155], "decrease": [158], "likelihood": [160], "symptomatic": [162], "recurrence.": [163]}, "authors": ["Michael Hoa", "John W.

satisfy a sizable group of patients with IPF that in the past had been lumped with UIP and now currently has begun to be recognized as nonspecific interstitial pneumonia/fibrosis (NIP). There are few reports about the clinical features of NIP. Methods The pathologic slides of 66 patients having open lung biopsy (OLB) for the differential diagnosis of interstitial lung diseases (ILD) from 1984 to 1995 were reviewed. Seven cases were confirmed as NIP. The clinical record, pulmonay function tests (PFT), chest PA and HRCT were reviewed and analysed retrospectively. Results Six patients with NIP were female. The median age was 56 years. Mean duration of symptoms was 4 months. Five patients had systemic flu-like symptoms. the most common respiratory symptom was gradual dyspnea Two patients revealed a mild degree of anemia Four cases had leukocytois of more than 10,000/mm3. ESR and CRP O.K. elevated in all measured cases. Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) was positive in three of six patients and ds-DNA antibody was positive in one of six patients Restrictive pattern of PFT was predominant. Diffusion capacity of carbonmonoxide (DLCO) decreased markedly. In bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), total cell counts elevated about three times of normal value. On differntial counts of BAL cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils were higher than those of normal controls. The prominent finding of chest radiology was bilaterally patchy opacifications in parenchyme of lower lung zones. On HRCT, bilaterally patchy areas of ground-glass attenuation and/or areas of alveolar consolidation were commonly shown. The number of pathologic type was one case of group I, four cases of group II and two cases of group III. The average period from diagnosis to the last follow-up was 24.8 months. Five patients were clinically recovered to the previously well-being state. Conclusion Patients with NIP had different clinical features from UIP, AIP and DIP. They also had characteristic findings of radiology and their prognosis seems to be better than UIP."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2036219678", "relevance_score": 201.26212, "publication_year": 2015, "title": "Perforation of gastrointestinal tract by poorly conspicuous ingested foreign bodies: radiological diagnosis", "cited_by_count": 36, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Perforation", "level": 3, "score": 0.75765973}, {"display_name": "Foreign body", "level": 2, "score": 0.70210296}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.6168628}, {"display_name": "Radiography", "level": 2, "score": 0.5506421}, {"display_name": "Foreign Bodies", "level": 2, "score": 0.45060185}, {"display_name": "Radiological weapon", "level": 2, "score": 0.43135118}, {"display_name": "Presentation (obstetrics)", "level": 2, "score": 0.4114935}, {"display_name": "Surgery", "level": 1, "score": 0.39579058}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Perforation": [0], "of": [1, 44, 68, 82, 115, 120, 131, 150, 153, 171, 194], "gastrointestinal": [2], "(GI)": [3], "tract": [4], "by": [5, 144, 206], "ingested": [6, 93], "bone": [7, 208], "fragments,": [8, 209], "toothpicks": [9], "and": [10, 20, 32, 128, 184, 197, 213], "dentures": [11], "is": [12, 28, 35, 65, 96], "rare": [13], "but": [14, 70], "remains": [15], "an": [16, 92], "important": [17, 173], "life-threatening": [18], "condition,": [19], "the": [21, 26, 62, 66, 118, 129, 141, 145, 151, 166, 169, 192], "outcomes": [22], "are": [23, 53], "poorer": [24], "when": [25, 91], "diagnosis": [27, 34, 143, 170, 183], "delayed.": [29], "Invariably,": [30], "clinical": [31, 126], "radiographic": [33, 196], "difficult": [36], "as": [37], "most": [38], "patients": [39, 78], "will": [40, 164, 179], "have": [41], "no": [42], "recollection": [43], "ingesting": [45], "a": [46, 106], "foreign": [47, 94, 107], "body,": [48, 108], "whereas": [49], "these": [50, 132], "subtle": [51, 138], "objects": [52, 135], "often": [54, 175], "not": [55, 97], "visible": [56], "on": [57, 157], "radiographs.": [58], "In": [59, 187], "search": [60], "for": [61], "diagnosis,": [63], "CT": [64, 158], "modality": [67], "choice,": [69], "ultrasound": [71, 100, 163, 198], "imaging": [72, 199], "may": [73], "be": [74, 137], "first": [75], "requested": [76], "in": [77, 104, 168, 202], "presenting": [79], "with": [80, 124], "symptoms": [81], "acute": [83], "appendicitis,": [84], "cholecystitis,": [85], "pyelonephritis": [86], "or": [87, 160], "pelvic": [88], "inflammatory": [89], "disease": [90], "body": [95], "considered.": [98], "Although": [99], "has": [101], "limited": [102], "value": [103], "depicting": [105], "it": [109], "can": [110], "frequently": [111], "uncover": [112], "secondary": [113], "signs": [114], "perforation.": [116], "However,": [117], "rarity": [119], "this": [121, 172, 188], "condition": [122], "combined": [123], "non-specific": [125], "presentation": [127], "propensity": [130], "small": [133], "perforating": [134], "to": [136, 181], "makes": [139], "establishing": [140], "correct": [142], "radiologist": [146, 167], "challenging.": [147], "Therefore,": [148], "understanding": [149], "appearances": [152], "GI": [154, 203], "perforation": [155, 204], "seen": [156, 201], "images": [159], "general": [161], "abdominal": [162], "aid": [165], "yet": [174], "unsuspected": [176], "condition.": [177], "This": [178], "lead": [180], "earlier": [182], "surgical": [185], "management.": [186], "article,": [189], "we": [190], "illustrate": [191], "spectrum": [193], "CT,": [195], "features": [200], "caused": [205], "swallowed": [207], "toothpicks,": [210], "cocktail": [211], "sticks": [212], "dentures.": [214]}, "authors": ["Siarhei Kuzmich", "Christopher J.

Invariably, clinical and radiographic diagnosis is difficult as most patients will have no recollection of ingesting a foreign body, whereas these subtle objects are often not visible on radiographs. In search for the diagnosis, CT is the modality of choice, but ultrasound imaging may be first requested in patients presenting with symptoms of acute appendicitis, cholecystitis, pyelonephritis or pelvic inflammatory disease when an ingested foreign body is not considered. Although ultrasound has limited value in depicting a foreign body, it can frequently uncover secondary signs of perforation. However, the rarity of this condition combined with non-specific clinical presentation and the propensity of these small perforating objects to be subtle makes establishing the correct diagnosis by the radiologist challenging. Therefore, understanding of the appearances of GI perforation seen on CT images or general abdominal ultrasound will aid the radiologist in the diagnosis of this important yet often unsuspected condition. This will lead to earlier diagnosis and surgical management. In this article, we illustrate the spectrum of CT, radiographic and ultrasound imaging features seen in GI perforation caused by swallowed bone fragments, toothpicks, cocktail sticks and dentures."},

Demographic, clinical, and radiologic data, including assessment of pain, dysfunction, improvement, and satisfaction, and maximal mouth opening were analyzed.ResultsThe analysis included 67 female patients (84.8%) and 12 male patients (15.2%), 13 to 70 years old, who were followed for 56.9 \u00b1 6.7 months. Sixty-four (81%) reacted favorably to arthrocentesis. For these patients, maximal mouth opening increased from 26.3 \u00b1 0.8 to 39.24 \u00b1 0.9 mm (P < .001). Pain and dysfunction scores decreased from 6.92 \u00b1 0.2 to 2.36 \u00b1 0.3 (P < .001) and from 7.37 \u00b1 0.2 to 2.24 \u00b1 0.4 (P < .001), respectively. Overall score for patient satisfaction with arthrocentesis was 8.78 \u00b1 0.3. The procedure had no lasting complications. Remarkably, the severity of preoperative pain, dysfunction, and range of motion and of radiographic changes did not correlate with the outcome of arthrocentesis. The severity of preoperative or postoperative signs and symptoms was not correlated with the severity of radiographic changes.ConclusionsFor most patients, arthrocentesis offers long-term favorable outcomes for symptomatic TMJ osteoarthritis that has not responded to nonsurgical treatments and otherwise would have required surgical arthroplasty. Severity of preoperative clinical and computerized tomographic findings is not predictive for the success of arthrocentesis. In addition, the lack of correlation between the clinical and radiologic findings negates the commonly used Wilkes classification, which presumes that the clinical signs and symptoms deteriorate together with radiologic changes. To evaluate the long-term outcome of arthrocentesis in patients with symptomatic temporomandibular joint (TMJ) osteoarthritis that was unresponsive to nonsurgical interventions. Seventy-nine patients (83 joints) with symptomatic TMJ osteoarthritis that had not responded to nonsurgical interventions and who underwent arthrocentesis were included in this study. Demographic, clinical, and radiologic data, including assessment of pain, dysfunction, improvement, and satisfaction, and maximal mouth opening were analyzed. The analysis included 67 female patients (84.8%) and 12 male patients (15.2%), 13 to 70 years old, who were followed for 56.9 \u00b1 6.7 months. Sixty-four (81%) reacted favorably to arthrocentesis. For these patients, maximal mouth opening increased from 26.3 \u00b1 0.8 to 39.24 \u00b1 0.9 mm (P < .001). Pain and dysfunction scores decreased from 6.92 \u00b1 0.2 to 2.36 \u00b1 0.3 (P < .001) and from 7.37 \u00b1 0.2 to 2.24 \u00b1 0.4 (P < .001), respectively. Overall score for patient satisfaction with arthrocentesis was 8.78 \u00b1 0.3. The procedure had no lasting complications. Remarkably, the severity of preoperative pain, dysfunction, and range of motion and of radiographic changes did not correlate with the outcome of arthrocentesis. The severity of preoperative or postoperative signs and symptoms was not correlated with the severity of radiographic changes. For most patients, arthrocentesis offers long-term favorable outcomes for symptomatic TMJ osteoarthritis that has not responded to nonsurgical treatments and otherwise would have required surgical arthroplasty. Severity of preoperative clinical and computerized tomographic findings is not predictive for the success of arthrocentesis. In addition, the lack of correlation between the clinical and radiologic findings negates the commonly used Wilkes classification, which presumes that the clinical signs and symptoms deteriorate together with radiologic changes."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W3081384154", "relevance_score": 191.9448, "publication_year": 2020, "title": "First report on clinical and radiological features of COVID-19 pneumonitis in a Caucasian population: Factors predicting fibrotic evolution", "cited_by_count": 36, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Pulmonary fibrosis", "level": 3, "score": 0.6278311}, {"display_name": "Hydroxychloroquine", "level": 5, "score": 0.5980827}, {"display_name": "Internal medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.5474761}, {"display_name": "Fibrosis", "level": 2, "score": 0.5238005}, {"display_name": "Pneumonitis", "level": 3, "score": 0.49869466}, {"display_name": "Gastroenterology", "level": 1, "score": 0.48591724}, {"display_name": "Population", "level": 2, "score": 0.4796165}, {"display_name": "Hypersensitivity pneumonitis", "level": 3, "score": 0.45647886}, {"display_name": "Lung", "level": 2, "score": 0.3738562}, {"display_name": "Pathology", "level": 1, "score": 0.33371693}, {"display_name": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)", "level": 4, "score": 0.29790998}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"BackgroundAt": [0], "the": [1, 5, 13, 17, 23, 38, 44, 62, 106, 153, 204], "end": [2], "of": [3, 16, 28, 40, 49, 64, 110, 151, 177, 219], "February,": [4], "Lombardy": [6], "region": [7], "(Northern": [8], "Italy)": [9], "was": [10, 102, 126], "involved": [11], "in": [12, 36, 148, 194, 229], "pandemic": [14], "spread": [15], "new": [18], "COVID-19.": [19], "We": [20], "here": [21], "summarize": [22], "clinical": [24, 45], "and": [25, 32, 46, 66, 70, 92, 136, 144, 160, 181, 183, 197, 232, 236], "radiological": [26, 47], "characteristics": [27], "90": [29, 50], "confirmed": [30], "cases": [31], "analyze": [33], "their": [34], "role": [35], "predicting": [37], "evolution": [39, 223], "fibrosis.MethodsWe": [41], "retrospectively": [42], "analyzed": [43], "data": [48, 201], "patients": [51, 115, 170, 233], "with": [52, 73, 190, 209, 234], "COVID-19": [53, 166, 220], "pneumonitis.": [54, 221], "All": [55], "subjects": [56], "underwent": [57], "an": [58], "HRCT": [59, 217], "study": [60], "on": [61], "day": [63, 83], "admission": [65], "eight": [67], "weeks": [68], "later,": [69], "were": [71, 121, 132], "treated": [72], "lopinavir": [74], "+": [75, 86], "ritonavir": [76, 87], "(Kaletra)": [77], "400/100": [78], "mg": [79, 95], "two": [80, 88, 96], "times": [81, 89, 97], "a": [82, 90, 98, 164, 174, 191, 210, 215], "or": [84], "darunavir": [85], "day,": [91], "Hydroxychloroquine": [93], "200": [94], "day.": [99], "Pulmonary": [100], "fibrosis": [101, 118, 172, 226], "defined": [103], "according": [104], "to": [105, 162, 185, 224], "Fleischner": [107], "Society": [108], "glossary": [109], "terms": [111], "for": [112], "thoracic": [113], "imaging.ResultsTwenty-three": [114], "developed": [116], "pulmonary": [117, 225], "(25.5%):": [119], "15": [120], "males,": [122], "whose": [123], "mean": [124], "age": [125], "75": [127], "\u00b1": [128], "15.": [129], "The": [130, 169, 222], "majority": [131], "active": [133], "smokers": [134], "(60.8%)": [135], "had": [137, 173], "comorbidities": [138, 235], "(78.2%),": [139], "above": [140], "all,": [141], "hypertension": [142], "(47.8%),": [143], "diabetes": [145], "(34.7%).": [146], "Interestingly,": [147], "our": [149, 200], "series": [150], "cases,": [152], "\"reversed": [154], "halo": [155, 206], "sign\"": [156], "is": [157, 227], "frequent": [158, 228], "(63%)": [159], "seems": [161], "be": [163, 214], "typical": [165, 216], "pneumonitis": [167], "pattern.": [168], "showing": [171], "higher": [175], "grade": [176], "systemic": [178], "inflammation": [179], "(ESR": [180], "PCR)": [182], "appeared": [184], "have": [186], "bone": [187, 237], "marrow": [188, 238], "inhibition": [189], "significant": [192], "reduction": [193], "platelets,": [195], "leukocytes,": [196], "hemoglobin.ConclusionsTo": [198], "conclude,": [199], "showed": [202], "that": [203], "reversed": [205], "sign": [207], "associated": [208], "ground-glass": [211], "pattern": [212, 218], "may": [213], "older": [230], "males": [231], "involvement.": [239]}, "authors": ["Maurizio Marvisi", "F Ferrozzi", "Laura Balzarini", "C.

We here summarize the clinical and radiological characteristics of 90 confirmed cases and analyze their role in predicting the evolution of fibrosis.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed the clinical and radiological data of 90 patients with COVID-19 pneumonitis. All subjects underwent an HRCT study on the day of admission and eight weeks later, and were treated with lopinavir + ritonavir (Kaletra) 400/100 mg two times a day or darunavir + ritonavir two times a day, and Hydroxychloroquine 200 mg two times a day. Pulmonary fibrosis was defined according to the Fleischner Society glossary of terms for thoracic imaging.ResultsTwenty-three patients developed pulmonary fibrosis (25.5%): 15 were males, whose mean age was 75 \u00b1 15. The majority were active smokers (60.8%) and had comorbidities (78.2%), above all, hypertension (47.8%), and diabetes (34.7%). Interestingly, in our series of cases, the \"reversed halo sign\" is frequent (63%) and seems to be a typical COVID-19 pneumonitis pattern. The patients showing fibrosis had a higher grade of systemic inflammation (ESR and PCR) and appeared to have bone marrow inhibition with a significant reduction in platelets, leukocytes, and hemoglobin.ConclusionsTo conclude, our data showed that the reversed halo sign associated with a ground-glass pattern may be a typical HRCT pattern of COVID-19 pneumonitis.

MERR supplements text-only reports by embedding user-friendly interactive hyperlinks to key images and graphically plotting target lesion size longitudinally over time. Methods Of 402 physicians responding to a web-based survey, 200 (50 each medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, neurosurgeons, and pulmonologists) practicing in the United States fulfilled criteria to complete an online survey with questions focusing on satisfaction with current text-only reports and the perceived value of image- and data-enriched reporting. Results The mean respondent age was 46 years, with a mean of 15 years in posttraining clinical practice (85% men; 47% from academic medical centers). Although 80% were satisfied with the format of their current text-only radiology reports, 80% believed that MERR would represent an improvement. The most commonly reported advantages of MERR were \u201cimproved understanding of radiology findings by correlating images to text reports\u201d (86%) and \u201ceasier access to images while monitoring progression of a disease/condition\u201d (79%). Of the 28% of physicians with concerns about MERR implementation, the most common were that it was \u201ctoo time intensive\u201d (53%) and \u201cthe clinic workflow does not allow itself to view reports in such a fashion\u201d (42%). Physicians indicated a strong increased likelihood of preferentially referring patients to (80%) and recommending peers to (79%) facilities that offer MERR. Conclusion Most specialist referring physicians believe that interactive image- and data-embedded MERR represents an improvement over current text-only radiology reporting. Compared with current report formatting, most would preferentially refer patients and peers to facilities offering more meaningful image- and graphically enriched reporting platforms."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2889418995", "relevance_score": 181.34871, "publication_year": 2018, "title": "Radiologic-Pathologic Correlation of Tumor Thickness and Its Prognostic Importance in Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Oral Cavity: Implications for the Eighth Edition Tumor, Node, Metastasis Classification", "cited_by_count": 36, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.5614149}, {"display_name": "Metastasis", "level": 3, "score": 0.51296633}, {"display_name": "Inter-rater reliability", "level": 3, "score": 0.4621772}, {"display_name": "Cancer", "level": 2, "score": 0.43877932}, {"display_name": "Basal cell", "level": 2, "score": 0.42766047}, {"display_name": "Correlation", "level": 2, "score": 0.42312977}, {"display_name": "Nuclear medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.37511212}, {"display_name": "Pathology", "level": 1, "score": 0.27905256}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"<h3>BACKGROUND": [0], "AND": [1, 44], "PURPOSE:</h3>": [2], "Addressing": [3], "the": [4, 29, 52, 57, 98, 106, 128, 138, 142, 163, 171, 246, 267], "performance": [5, 126, 156], "of": [6, 51, 56, 97, 120, 141, 174, 225, 270, 309], "an": [7, 193, 222], "imaging-based": [8], "parameter": [9], "compared": [10], "to": [11, 19, 27, 86], "a": [12, 288], "\u201cgold": [13], "standard\u201d": [14], "pathologic": [15, 47, 256, 261], "measurement": [16], "is": [17], "essential": [18], "achieve": [20], "accurate": [21], "clinical": [22], "T-classification.": [23], "Our": [24], "aim": [25], "was": [26, 77, 93, 108, 116, 133, 168, 213, 240, 253, 302, 307], "determine": [28], "radiologic-pathologic": [30, 89, 164, 236, 290], "tumor": [31, 75, 90, 114, 122, 144, 165, 237, 251, 272, 291, 300, 306], "thickness": [32, 76, 91, 115, 123, 145, 166, 238, 252, 273, 292, 301], "correlation": [33, 92, 107, 119, 167, 239], "and": [34, 70, 102, 124, 155, 200, 207, 210, 216, 258, 295], "its": [35, 125], "prognostic": [36, 139, 268], "value": [37, 140, 269], "in": [38, 188], "oral": [39, 63], "squamous": [40, 64], "cell": [41, 65], "carcinoma.": [42], "<h3>MATERIALS": [43], "METHODS:</h3>": [45], "All": [46], "T1\u2013T3": [48], "(seventh": [49], "edition": [50, 130, 153], "<i>Cancer": [53], "Staging": [54], "Manual</i>": [55], "American": [58], "Joint": [59], "Committee": [60], "on": [61, 79, 105, 112, 249], "Cancer)": [62], "carcinomas": [66], "diagnosed": [67], "between": [68], "2010": [69], "2015": [71], "were": [72, 230], "reviewed.": [73], "Radiologic": [74], "measured": [78], "preoperative": [80], "CT": [81, 199], "or": [82], "MR": [83, 201], "imaging": [84, 103, 202], "blinded": [85], "pathology.": [87], "The": [88, 95, 118, 235, 242], "calculated.": [94, 117], "impact": [96], "imaging-to-surgery": [99, 223], "time": [100], "interval": [101, 173, 195, 224], "technique": [104], "explored.": [109], "Intra-/interrater": [110], "reliability": [111, 212, 297], "radiologic": [113, 143, 250, 271, 299], "radiologic-versus-pathologic": [121], "as": [127], "seventh": [129, 152], "T-category": [131], "modifier": [132], "evaluated.": [134], "Multivariable": [135, 264], "analysis": [136, 265], "assessed": [137], "for": [146, 150, 170, 232, 244, 255, 260, 281, 298], "overall": [147, 282], "survival": [148], "adjusted": [149], "age,": [151], "T-category,": [154], "status.": [157], "<h3>RESULTS:</h3>": [158], "For": [159], "354": [160], "consecutive": [161], "patients,": [162], "similar": [169, 204], "image-to-surgery": [172], "\u22644.0": [175], "weeks": [176, 182], "(\u03c1": [177, 183, 196], "=": [178, 184, 197, 276, 279], "0.76)": [179], "versus": [180], "4\u20138": [181], "0.80)": [185], "but": [186], "lower": [187], "those": [189], "with": [190, 221], "more": [191], "than": [192], "8-week": [194], "0.62).": [198], "had": [203], "correlations": [205], "(0.76": [206], "0.80).": [208], "Intrarater": [209, 294], "interrater": [211, 296], "excellent": [214], "(0.88": [215], "0.84).": [217], "Excluding": [218], "19": [219], "cases": [220], "&gt;8": [226], "weeks,": [227], "335": [228], "patients": [229], "eligible": [231], "further": [233], "analysis.": [234], "0.78.": [241], "accuracy": [243], "upstaging": [245], "T-classification": [247], "based": [248], "83%": [254], "T1": [257], "74%": [259], "T2": [262], "tumors.": [263], "confirmed": [266], "(hazard": [274], "ratio": [275], "1.5,": [277], "<i>P</i>": [278], ".02)": [280], "survival.": [283, 311], "<h3>CONCLUSIONS:</h3>": [284], "This": [285], "study": [286], "demonstrates": [287], "good": [289], "correlation.": [293], "excellent.": [303], "Radiologically": [304], "thicker": [305], "predictive": [308], "inferior": [310]}, "authors": ["Emillie Weimar", "Shao Hui Huang", "Lin L\u00fc", "Brian O\u2019Sullivan", "Bayardo Perez-Ordonez", "Ilan Weinreb", "Andrew Hope", "Tong Li", "David P.

Our aim was to determine the radiologic-pathologic tumor thickness correlation and its prognostic value in oral squamous cell carcinoma. <h3>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</h3> All pathologic T1\u2013T3 (seventh edition of the <i>Cancer Staging Manual</i> of the American Joint Committee on Cancer) oral squamous cell carcinomas diagnosed between 2010 and 2015 were reviewed. Radiologic tumor thickness was measured on preoperative CT or MR imaging blinded to pathology. The radiologic-pathologic tumor thickness correlation was calculated. The impact of the imaging-to-surgery time interval and imaging technique on the correlation was explored. Intra-/interrater reliability on radiologic tumor thickness was calculated. The correlation of radiologic-versus-pathologic tumor thickness and its performance as the seventh edition T-category modifier was evaluated. Multivariable analysis assessed the prognostic value of the radiologic tumor thickness for overall survival adjusted for age, seventh edition T-category, and performance status. <h3>RESULTS:</h3> For 354 consecutive patients, the radiologic-pathologic tumor thickness correlation was similar for the image-to-surgery interval of \u22644.0 weeks (\u03c1 = 0.76) versus 4\u20138 weeks (\u03c1 = 0.80) but lower in those with more than an 8-week interval (\u03c1 = 0.62). CT and MR imaging had similar correlations (0.76 and 0.80). Intrarater and interrater reliability was excellent (0.88 and 0.84). Excluding 19 cases with an imaging-to-surgery interval of &gt;8 weeks, 335 patients were eligible for further analysis. The radiologic-pathologic tumor thickness correlation was 0.78. The accuracy for upstaging the T-classification based on radiologic tumor thickness was 83% for pathologic T1 and 74% for pathologic T2 tumors. Multivariable analysis confirmed the prognostic value of radiologic tumor thickness (hazard ratio = 1.5, <i>P</i> = .02) for overall survival. <h3>CONCLUSIONS:</h3> This study demonstrates a good radiologic-pathologic tumor thickness correlation. Intrarater and interrater reliability for radiologic tumor thickness was excellent. Radiologically thicker tumor was predictive of inferior survival."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2130010922", "relevance_score": 177.9678, "publication_year": 2015, "title": "Development and Utilization of a Web-Based Application as a Robust Radiology Teaching Tool (RadStax) for Medical Student Anatomy Teaching", "cited_by_count": 36, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Curriculum", "level": 2, "score": 0.71164113}, {"display_name": "The Internet", "level": 2, "score": 0.52567154}, {"display_name": "Software", "level": 2, "score": 0.50863874}, {"display_name": "Medical education", "level": 1, "score": 0.4909337}, {"display_name": "Resource (disambiguation)", "level": 2, "score": 0.47286937}, {"display_name": "Medical imaging", "level": 2, "score": 0.44188303}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.43745407}, {"display_name": "Web application", "level": 2, "score": 0.43536904}, {"display_name": "Gross anatomy", "level": 2, "score": 0.43392572}, {"display_name": "Multimedia", "level": 1, "score": 0.4061271}, {"display_name": "Medical physics", "level": 1, "score": 0.39984003}, {"display_name": "World Wide Web", "level": 1, "score": 0.24473193}, {"display_name": "Pathology", "level": 1, "score": 0.20678267}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Rationale": [0], "and": [1, 71, 76, 83, 85, 109, 115, 152, 177, 212], "Objectives:": [2], "The": [3, 156], "primary": [4], "role": [5], "of": [6, 15, 21, 35, 59, 68, 140, 198, 225], "radiology": [7], "in": [8, 237], "the": [9, 13, 56, 65, 69, 72, 138, 184, 206, 223, 239], "preclinical": [10, 240], "setting": [11], "is": [12, 77, 88, 187, 228], "use": [14], "imaging": [16], "to": [17, 42, 54, 194, 204, 222], "improve": [18], "students'": [19], "understanding": [20], "anatomy.": [22], "Many": [23], "currently": [24], "available": [25], "Web-based": [26, 90], "anatomy": [27, 49, 231], "programs": [28], "include": [29], "either": [30], "suboptimal": [31], "or": [32], "overwhelming": [33], "levels": [34], "detail": [36, 60], "for": [37, 61, 106, 121, 191, 219], "medical": [38, 74, 117, 133, 241], "students.Our": [39], "objective": [40], "was": [41, 99, 128], "develop": [43], "a": [44, 89, 153, 174, 188, 229], "user-friendly": [45], "software": [46], "program": [47, 157, 227], "that": [48, 234], "instructors": [50, 192], "can": [51], "completely": [52], "tailor": [53], "match": [55], "desired": [57], "level": [58], "their": [62, 125, 209], "curriculum,": [63], "meets": [64], "unique": [66], "needs": [67, 208], "first-": [70], "second-year": [73, 116], "students,": [75], "compatible": [78], "with": [79, 143, 183], "most": [80], "Internet": [81], "browsers": [82], "tablets.Materials": [84], "Methods:": [86], "RadStax": [87, 98, 127, 186], "application": [91, 190], "developed": [92], "using": [93], "free,": [94], "open-source,": [95], "ubiquitous": [96], "software.": [97], "first": [100], "introduced": [101, 130], "as": [102, 173], "an": [103, 196, 216], "interactive": [104, 217], "resource": [105], "independent": [107], "study": [108, 175], "later": [110], "incorporated": [111], "into": [112, 131], "lectures.": [113], "First-": [114], "students": [118, 166, 220], "were": [119], "surveyed": [120], "quantitative": [122], "feedback": [123, 161], "regarding": [124], "experience.Results:": [126], "successfully": [129], "our": [132], "school": [134], "curriculum.": [135, 210], "It": [136], "allows": [137], "creation": [139], "learning": [141], "modules": [142], "labeled": [144, 199], "multiplanar": [145], "(MPR)": [146], "image": [147], "sets,": [148], "basic": [149], "anatomic": [150], "information,": [151], "self-assessment": [154], "feature.": [155], "received": [158], "overwhelmingly": [159], "positive": [160], "from": [162], "students.": [163], "Of": [164], "115": [165], "surveyed,": [167], "87.0%": [168], "found": [169], "it": [170, 214], "highly": [171], "effective": [172], "tool": [176, 233], "85.2%": [178], "reported": [179], "high": [180], "user": [181], "satisfaction": [182], "program.Conclusions:": [185], "novel": [189], "wishing": [193], "create": [195], "atlas": [197], "MPR": [200], "radiologic": [201], "studies": [202], "tailored": [203], "meet": [205], "specific": [207], "Simple": [211], "focused,": [213], "provides": [215], "experience": [218], "similar": [221], "practice": [224], "radiologists.This": [226], "robust": [230], "teaching": [232], "effectively": [235], "aids": [236], "educating": [238], "student.": [242]}, "authors": ["Philip G.

Many currently available Web-based anatomy programs include either suboptimal or overwhelming levels of detail for medical students.Our objective was to develop a user-friendly software program that anatomy instructors can completely tailor to match the desired level of detail for their curriculum, meets the unique needs of the first- and the second-year medical students, and is compatible with most Internet browsers and tablets.Materials and Methods: RadStax is a Web-based application developed using free, open-source, ubiquitous software. RadStax was first introduced as an interactive resource for independent study and later incorporated into lectures. First- and second-year medical students were surveyed for quantitative feedback regarding their experience.Results: RadStax was successfully introduced into our medical school curriculum. It allows the creation of learning modules with labeled multiplanar (MPR) image sets, basic anatomic information, and a self-assessment feature. The program received overwhelmingly positive feedback from students. Of 115 students surveyed, 87.0% found it highly effective as a study tool and 85.2% reported high user satisfaction with the program.Conclusions: RadStax is a novel application for instructors wishing to create an atlas of labeled MPR radiologic studies tailored to meet the specific needs their curriculum. Simple and focused, it provides an interactive experience for students similar to the practice of radiologists.This program is a robust anatomy teaching tool that effectively aids in educating the

Therefore, radiologists' work in this area is likely to be enhanced by involving an individual with appropriate economics training on the research team when conducting an economic investigation. Clinical radiologists and investigators in radiologic sciences should be capable of understanding and evaluating the design, performance, and interpretation of results of economic investigations, since radiology practice is likely to be influenced by the findings from such research.

One measurement of efficiency is promptness in producing a final report. Many large radiology centers have radiology information systems (RIS) that track work flow, collecting tremendous amounts of data. Most, however, lack an appropriate analytic mechanism. We have developed an integrated system that allows continual monitoring of radiology work flow and thus of opportunities to apply interventions. This system can form an important component of the quality management process in the radiology department. In developing the system, we identified seven key steps in the work-flow process. When left to chance, these steps occur out of sequence and large delays occur. A scheme was devised to improve the sequencing of the work flow by using the data collected from the RIS, sorted by radiology division and patient type. Biweekly, the appropriate data file is transferred to each division for analysis, via the department's computer network. A one-step process follows, using desktop Macintosh computers and a custom program written in Microsoft Excel. Extracted data are quickly converted into a tailored division summary, and a report is automatically generated. The result summary format is uniform throughout the department, allowing ease of review at divisional and departmental meetings. Problems can be immediately localized to a specific step in the work-flow process. Automation of much of the system allows continual, near-real-time review of work flow. Using this approach, we have seen a sustained reduction of average report turnaround time. This system allows continual monitoring of work flow.

The method may be used as a component in a system which automatically generates follow-up information in a timely fashion. Methods A novel method of combining an LSP (labeled sequential pattern) classifier with a CRF (conditional random field) recognizer was devised. The LSP classifier filters out irrelevant sentences, while the CRF recognizer extracts follow-up and time phrases from candidate sentences presented by the LSP classifier. Measurements The standard performance metrics of precision (P), recall (R), and F measure (F) in the exact and inexact matching settings were used for evaluation. Results Four experiments conducted using 20 000 radiology reports showed that the CRF recognizer achieved high performance without time-consuming feature engineering and that the LSP classifier further improved the performance of the CRF recognizer. The performance of the current system is P=0.90, R=0.86, F=0.88 in the exact matching setting and P=0.98, R=0.93, F=0.95 in the inexact matching setting. Conclusion The experiments demonstrate that the system performs far better than a baseline rule-based system and is worth considering for deployment trials in an alert generation system.

We sought to determine whether preoperative computed tomography (CT) characteristics could guide decisions about the extent of the pulmonary resection.We reviewed the preoperative CT scans for 136 patients identified to have adenocarcinomas with lepidic features on the final pathologic evaluation. The solid component on CT was substituted for the invasive component, and patients were radiologically classified as adenocarcinoma in situ, 3 cm or less with no solid component; minimally invasive adenocarcinoma, 3 cm or less with a solid component of 5 mm or less; or invasive adenocarcinoma, exceeding 3 cm or solid component exceeding 5 mm, or both. Analysis of variance, t test, \u03c7(2) test, and Kaplan-Meier methods were used for analysis.The radiologic classification identified 35 adenocarcinomas in situ (26%) and 12 minimally invasive (9%) and 89 invasive adenocarcinoma (65%) lesions. At a 32-month median follow-up, patient outcomes associated with the radiologic classification were similar to the pathologic-based classification: the radiologic classification identified 14 of 16 patients with recurrent disease and all 6 who died of lung cancer. In addition, patients with radiologic adenocarcinoma in situ and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma who underwent sublobar resections had no recurrence and 100% disease-free and overall survival at 5 years.The radiologic classification of patients with lepidic adenocarcinomas is associated with similar oncologic and survival outcomes compared with the pathologic classification and may guide decision making in the approach to surgical resection."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W3020772391", "relevance_score": 258.34976, "publication_year": 2020, "title": "The Impact of COVID-19 on Interventional Radiology Training Programs: What You Need to Know", "cited_by_count": 35, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)", "level": 4, "score": 0.8825535}, {"display_name": "Pandemic", "level": 5, "score": 0.76203394}, {"display_name": "2019-20 coronavirus outbreak", "level": 3, "score": 0.6710021}, {"display_name": "Interventional radiology", "level": 2, "score": 0.64623}, {"display_name": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)", "level": 5, "score": 0.63359225}, {"display_name": "Medical education", "level": 1, "score": 0.5146476}, {"display_name": "Key (lock)", "level": 2, "score": 0.4866217}, {"display_name": "Training (meteorology)", "level": 2, "score": 0.45742217}, {"display_name": "Residency training", "level": 3, "score": 0.4425991}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.43392783}, {"display_name": "Medical physics", "level": 1, "score": 0.337996}, {"display_name": "Pathology", "level": 1, "score": 0.23740962}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"The": [0, 35], "COVID-19": [1, 17, 36, 52], "pandemic": [2, 37], "has": [3, 38], "affected": [4, 39], "medical": [5, 40], "education": [6, 41], "in": [7, 42], "unprecedented": [8, 43], "ways.": [9, 44], "Herein,": [10, 45], "we": [11, 46], "briefly": [12, 47], "describe": [13, 48], "the": [14, 49], "affects": [15, 50], "of": [16, 51], "on": [18, 53], "Interventional": [19, 54], "Radiology": [20, 55], "residency": [21, 56], "training": [22, 57], "and": [23, 32, 58, 67], "summarize": [24, 59], "up": [25, 60], "to": [26, 61], "date": [27, 62], "guidance": [28, 63], "by": [29, 64], "governing": [30, 65], "bodies": [31, 66], "key": [33, 68], "stakeholders.": [34, 69]}, "authors": ["Shantanu Warhadpande", "Minhaj S.

A multidisciplinary approach, a firm understanding of the similarities and differences between adult and pediatric arteriography, and meticulous technique ensure the safety of the pediatric patient when performing pediatric arteriography."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W1989851536", "relevance_score": 248.37697, "publication_year": 1972, "title": "THE FUNCTIONAL RADIOLOGY OF ECTOPIC URETEROCELE", "cited_by_count": 35, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Ureterocele", "level": 3, "score": 0.8741361}, {"display_name": "Radiological weapon", "level": 2, "score": 0.5475118}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.36843988}, {"display_name": "Surgery", "level": 1, "score": 0.36788064}, {"display_name": "General surgery", "level": 1, "score": 0.33209634}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"SUMMARY\r\n\r\nEctopic": [0], "ureterocele": [1], "is": [2, 26], "a": [3, 15], "common": [4], "condition": [5], "in": [6, 10, 37], "paediatrics,": [7], "which": [8, 38, 56], "can,": [9], "general,": [11], "be": [12], "recognised": [13], "from": [14], "standard": [16], "intravenous": [17], "urographic": [18], "series.": [19], "The": [20], "full": [21], "potential": [22], "of": [23, 35, 41, 53, 62], "radiological": [24], "diagnosis": [25], "seldom": [27], "exploited,": [28], "however,": [29], "and": [30, 51], "this": [31], "paper": [32], "gives": [33], "examples": [34], "ways": [36], "careful": [39], "studies": [40], "micturating": [42], "cystograms": [43], "can": [44], "give": [45], "precise": [46], "information": [47], "about": [48], "the": [49, 54], "nature": [50], "complications": [52], "ureterocele,": [55], "are": [57], "essential": [58], "for": [59], "rational": [60], "planning": [61], "surgical": [63], "treatment.": [64]}, "authors": ["D.

CORE cases were published using the CASUS authoring system, incorporating text, interactive questions, hyperlinks, and multimedia in a Web-based format. CORE cases are presented as clinical scenarios introducing students to simulated patients who undergo various radiologic imaging procedures during the course of their diseases and complications.Since 2005, 14 cases have been published. CORE incorporates more than 75% of the Alliance of Medical Student Educators in Radiology curriculum, with cases covering chest imaging, pediatric radiology, abdominal imaging, women's imaging, neuroradiology, and musculoskeletal imaging. CORE cases are taken during medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, and neurology clerkships by third-year and fourth-year medical students. The majority of students surveyed agreed or strongly agreed that CORE cases made good use of their self-directed study time (84%), provided useful resources (73%), were appropriate for their level of training (86%), and expanded their knowledge and understanding of radiology (88%).The integration of CORE cases into clinical clerkships provides medical students with the opportunity to learn a standardized radiology curriculum in an interactive, online, and case-based format tailored specifically for medical students.

METHODS--Radiographs from 174 blue collar workers and 29 white collar workers from an asbestos cement plant formed one part of the study. Progression of small opacities was further studied in those 124 blue collar workers, for whom two radiographs taken after the end of employment were available. The median readings from five readers who used the full ILO 1980 classification were used. As exposure indices, time since start of employment, duration of employment, cumulative exposure, and average intensity of asbestos exposure were used. The influence of age and smoking was also considered in multiple logistic regression analyses. RESULTS--Small opacities (profusion &gt; or = 1/0) were closely correlated with time related exposure variables, and showed weaker association with intensity based exposure variables. The odds ratio (OR) for small opacities was equal to 2.8 (90% CI 1.2, 6.7) in the &gt; 30 f(fibre)-y/ml group, compared with those in the 0-10 f-y/ml group. Progression of at least two minor ILO categories after the end of employment was seen in 20%. Also, pleural thickening was closely related to time. By contrast, costophrenic angle obliterations were not associated with the time related variables, but closely associated with the intensity of asbestos exposure, and tended to occur during employment. The OR was 4.5 (90% CI 1.3, 15) in the &gt; 2 f/ml group, compared with those in the 0-1 f/ml group. CONCLUSIONS--In these workers, exposed mainly to chrysotile but also to small amounts of amphibole, the risk of radiographically visible parenchymal abnormality was substantially increased and strongly dependent on time related exposure variables. Progression was found long after the end of exposure. The findings on costophrenic angle obliterations, supposed to be sequelae of benign pleural effusions, were consistent with an immediate reaction triggered by intense asbestos exposure."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2023060397", "relevance_score": 229.31342, "publication_year": 2009, "title": "Magnetic resonance imaging of acute intramedullary myelopathy: radiological differential diagnosis for the on-call radiologist", "cited_by_count": 35, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Magnetic resonance imaging", "level": 2, "score": 0.7968411}, {"display_name": "Intramedullary rod", "level": 2, "score": 0.7830274}, {"display_name": "Spinal cord", "level": 2, "score": 0.714916}, {"display_name": "Myelopathy", "level": 3, "score": 0.70752215}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.60106015}, {"display_name": "Radiological weapon", "level": 2, "score": 0.5812365}, {"display_name": "Cord", "level": 2, "score": 0.5798914}, {"display_name": "Differential diagnosis", "level": 2, "score": 0.5676883}, {"display_name": "Spinal cord compression", "level": 3, "score": 0.49218407}, {"display_name": "Spinal Cord Diseases", "level": 3, "score": 0.4141279}, {"display_name": "Surgery", "level": 1, "score": 0.31580007}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Spinal": [0], "cord": [1, 77, 86, 107], "disease": [2], "is": [3, 16, 40, 48, 59, 66, 75], "often": [4, 41], "viewed": [5], "as": [6, 38], "having": [7], "a": [8, 21, 85, 97], "poor": [9], "outcome.": [10], "Although": [11], "in": [12], "certain": [13], "conditions": [14], "this": [15], "true,": [17], "non-traumatic": [18, 104], "myelopathy": [19], "encompasses": [20], "vast": [22], "array": [23], "of": [24, 27, 53, 84, 99, 103, 110], "diseases": [25], "some": [26], "which": [28, 88, 111], "are": [29, 81, 89], "exquisitely": [30], "responsive": [31], "to": [32, 50, 71, 95], "treatment.": [33], "Accurate": [34], "diagnosis": [35, 58], "becomes": [36], "important": [37], "damage": [39], "progressive": [42], "and": [43, 46, 69], "long-term": [44], "disability": [45], "morbidity": [47], "related": [49], "the": [51, 57, 100], "degree": [52], "neurological": [54], "impairment": [55], "when": [56], "reached.": [60], "Out-of-hours": [61], "magnetic": [62], "resonance": [63], "imaging": [64, 101], "(MRI)": [65], "generally": [67], "requested": [68], "performed": [70], "ascertain": [72], "whether": [73], "there": [74, 80], "spinal": [76, 106], "compression;": [78], "however,": [79], "other": [82], "causes": [83], "syndrome,": [87], "more": [90], "subtle.": [91], "This": [92], "review": [93], "aims": [94], "provide": [96], "summary": [98], "features": [102], "intramedullary": [105], "emergencies,": [108], "many": [109], "may": [112], "appear": [113], "radiologically": [114], "similar.": [115]}, "authors": ["Fintan Sheerin", "Kathryn Collison", "Gerardine Quaghebeur"], "abstract": "Spinal cord disease is often viewed as having a poor outcome.

Materials and Methods In this institutional review board\u2013approved study, an electronic survey was sent to first authors of all original research articles published in American Journal of Roentgenology, European Radiology, Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and Radiology during 2 years (July 2009 through June 2011). Questions addressed guidelines used for determining authorship, perception of honorary authorship, and demographic information. Univariate analysis was performed by using \u03c72 tests. Multiple-variable logistic regression models were used to assess independent factors associated with the perception of honorary authorship. Results Of 1398 first authors, 328 (23.5%) responded. Of these, 91 (27.7%) perceived that at least one coauthor did not make sufficient contributions to merit authorship, and 165 (50.3%) stated that one or more coauthors performed only \u201cnonauthor\u201d tasks according to International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) criteria. The perception of honorary authorship was significantly higher (P \u2264 .0001) among respondents from Asia and Europe than from North America and in institutions where a section or department head was automatically listed as coauthor. A significantly lower (P \u2264 .0001) perception of honorary authorship was associated with adherence to ICMJE criteria and with policies providing lectures or courses on publication ethics. Conclusion Perceived honorary authorship was substantially higher among respondents from Asia and Europe than from North America.

(114 patients) or 3 mg/kg intramuscularly (i.m.) (97 patients). Atropine sulfate (Fujisawa USA, Deerfield, IL) (0.01 mg/kg i.v. or 0.02 mg/kg i.m.) was added in all patients to control secretions. Patients were monitored with continuous pulse oximetry and with automatic blood pressure cuffs. Respiratory rate and heart rate were recorded every 5 min. Adequacy of sedation was graded by the radiologist. Induction time, procedure time, recovery time, and adverse effects were recorded.Sedation was considered excellent and the procedures were completed in 191 patients (91%). The sedation was considered light but the procedures were completed in the remaining 20 patients (9%). No sedation failures were observed. Average induction time was 45 sec for the i.v. procedure and 4 min for the i.m. procedure. Average recovery time was 18 min for the i.v. procedure and 25 min for the i.m. procedure. Average procedure time for both methods was 25 min. Hemoglobin saturation remained at or greater than 95% in 200 patients (94%). Transient desaturation below 95% occurred in 11 patients (5%). The airway was manipulated to improve ventilation (head, neck, and jaw lifts) and supplemental oxygen was given via nasal cannula or mask. The episodes lasted only a few seconds and oxygen saturation promptly returned to a level greater than 95%. A 7-week-old male infant who had been born prematurely at 32 weeks' gestation experienced apnea. Ventilation was assisted for several breaths and the patient promptly recovered. We observed only minor cardiovascular changes in all patients.Ketamine hydrochloride provides excellent sedation and analgesia in young children. The short induction time, rapid recovery, and minimal respiratory depression are features that make this sedative ideal for interventional radiology."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2120025494", "relevance_score": 209.59128, "publication_year": 1998, "title": "Venous chest anatomy: clinical implications 1This article has been extracted from a chapter in: Chasen MH, Charnsangavej C.

Routine radiography, conventional venography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging studies provide correlative anatomic models for the demonstration of how interconnecting collateral vascular networks within the thorax maintain venous stability at all times. Five major systems comprise the collateral venous network of the thorax (Fig. 1). These include the paravertebral, azygos-hemiazygos, internal mammary, lateral thoracic, and anterior jugular venous systems (AJVS). The five systems are presented in the following sequence: (a) a brief introduction to the importance of catheter position and malposition in understanding access to the thoracic venous system, (b) the anatomy of the azygos-hemiazygos systems and their relationship with the paravertebral plexus, (c) the importance of the AJVS, (d) 'loop' concepts interconnecting the internal mammary and azygos-hemiazygos systems by means of the lateral thoracic and intercostal veins, and (e) the interconnecting venous networks on the thoracic side of the thoracoabdominal junction. Certain aspects of the venous anatomy of the thorax will not be discussed in this chapter and include (a) the intra-abdominal anastomoses between the superior and inferior vena cavae (IVC) via the internal mammary, lateral thoracic, and azygos-hemiazygos systems (beyond the scope of this article), (b) potential collateral vessels involving vertebral, parascapular, thyroidal, thymic, and other smaller veins that might anastomose with the major systems, and (c) anatomic variants and pitfalls that may mimic pathologic conditions (space limitations)."}, {"id":

Previous studies on the reproducibility of radiological findings have been limited in size and based only on infants with the disease. We conducted a study among a sample of high\u2010risk infants with and without the diagnosis of NEC: (1) to measure the degree of inter\u2010observer agreement of NEC radiological diagnosis and signs and (2) identify a profile of radiological signs which led the observers to make a diagnosis of NEC. We collected 297 X\u2010rays from a sample of 57 newborns admitted in 1999 to neonatal intensive care and neonatal surgery units in Rome, Italy. Three specialists in paediatric radiology examined the films independently and without any clinical information about patients. The analyses were conducted on a total of 891 forms filled in by the observers. Kappa values were calculated to measure the inter\u2010observer reliability. To identify the profiles of radiological signs, a multidimensional analysis, binary segmentation, was carried out. The reproducibility of radiographic signs was 0.55 ( P &lt; 0.01) for diffuse gaseous intestinal distention, 0.22 ( P &lt; 0.01) for bowel wall thickening, 0.10 ( P &lt; 0.01) for presence of portal venous gas and 0.29 ( P &lt; 0.01) for pneumatosis intestinalis. The agreement for radiographic diagnosis suspected/confirmed of NEC was 0.31 ( P &lt; 0.01). Among the 23 possible combinations of radiographic signs, the three radiologists indicated four profiles that produced a diagnosis of NEC containing, respectively, two, three, four and five signs. Our study found, in a large sample of radiographs selected from a population of infants with and without NEC, a poor reliability for NEC diagnosis and individual radiological signs among three expert radiologists. Clinical information and the presence of more than one radiological sign can reduce the margin of observer's error that inevitably exists when dealing with a diagnosis as difficult as NEC."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W3102905714", "relevance_score": 178.52448, "publication_year": 2020, "title": "Clinical and Radiological Outcomes of Meniscal Repair Versus Partial Meniscectomy for Medial Meniscus Root Tears: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis", "cited_by_count": 35, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Medial meniscus", "level": 4, "score": 0.68998677}, {"display_name": "Surgery", "level": 1, "score": 0.6576361}, {"display_name": "Meniscus", "level": 3, "score": 0.6315934}, {"display_name": "Osteoarthritis", "level": 3, "score": 0.612718}, {"display_name": "Radiological weapon", "level": 2, "score": 0.6033233}, {"display_name": "Meta-analysis", "level": 2, "score": 0.54210913}, {"display_name": "Tears", "level": 2, "score": 0.53691715}, {"display_name": "Odds ratio", "level": 2, "score": 0.43334368}, {"display_name": "Arthroscopy", "level": 2, "score": 0.41904283}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Given": [0], "the": [1, 13, 41, 80, 143, 155, 183, 186, 190], "superiority": [2], "of": [3, 16, 26, 74, 127, 135, 167, 201, 215, 226, 250], "meniscal": [4, 17, 47, 58, 93, 121, 144, 168, 227, 233], "repair": [5, 18, 48, 59, 94, 122, 145, 169, 234], "over": [6], "partial": [7, 27, 50, 70, 96, 118, 148, 237], "meniscectomy": [8, 28, 51, 97, 119, 149, 238], "according": [9], "to": [10, 21, 39, 116, 160, 182, 252], "biomechanical": [11], "data,": [12], "clinical": [14, 42, 64], "outcomes": [15, 103, 229], "are": [19], "likely": [20], "be": [22], "better": [23, 63], "than": [24], "those": [25], "for": [29, 52, 123, 239], "a": [30], "medial": [31], "meniscus": [32], "root": [33], "tear": [34], "(MMRT).This": [35], "review": [36, 81], "was": [37, 55, 137, 162, 178], "designed": [38], "compare": [40, 117], "and": [43, 49, 65, 98, 139, 147, 247, 255], "radiological": [44, 66, 105], "results": [45, 67], "between": [46, 189], "MMRTs.": [53], "It": [54], "hypothesized": [56], "that": [57, 214], "would": [60], "result": [61], "in": [62, 79, 142, 154, 165, 185, 224, 244], "compared": [68, 235], "with": [69, 87, 111, 120, 180, 236, 241], "meniscectomy.Systematic": [71], "review;": [72], "Level": [73], "evidence,": [75], "4.Studies": [76], "were": [77, 114, 130, 222, 230], "included": [78, 85], "if": [82], "they": [83], "(1)": [84], "patients": [86], "MMRTs": [88], "who": [89], "underwent": [90], "primary": [91], "arthroscopic": [92], "or": [95], "(2)": [99], "analyzed": [100], "validated": [101], "patient-reported": [102], "and/or": [104], "evaluations.": [106], "Summary": [107], "odds": [108], "ratios": [109], "(ORs)": [110], "95%": [112], "CIs": [113], "calculated": [115], "each": [124], "outcome.A": [125], "total": [126], "13": [128], "studies": [129], "included.": [131], "The": [132, 152, 199], "mean": [133], "duration": [134], "follow-up": [136], "33.5": [138], "47.2": [140], "months": [141], "group": [146], "group,": [150], "respectively.": [151], "change": [153, 184], "Lysholm": [156, 245], "score": [157, 188], "from": [158], "preoperatively": [159], "postoperatively": [161], "statistically": [163], "significantly": [164, 223], "favor": [166, 225], "(OR,": [170, 194, 206, 217], "2.20": [171], "[95%": [172, 196, 208, 219], "CI,": [173, 197, 209, 220], "1.55-3.12]),": [174], "while": [175], "no": [176], "difference": [177], "found": [179], "respect": [181], "Tegner": [187], "2": [191], "surgical": [192], "approaches": [193], "1.21": [195], "0.65-2.24]).": [198], "prevalence": [200], "postoperative": [202], "severe": [203], "knee": [204, 253], "osteoarthritis": [205], "0.31": [207], "0.17-0.54])": [210], "as": [211, 213], "well": [212], "reoperations": [216], "0.05": [218], "0.01-0.19])": [221], "repair.Better": [228], "seen": [231], "after": [232], "MMRTs,": [240], "greater": [242], "improvements": [243], "scores,": [246], "lower": [248, 256], "rates": [249], "progression": [251], "osteoarthritis,": [254], "reoperation": [257], "rate.": [258]}, "authors": ["Kyung Han Ro", "Junho Kim", "Jae-Won Heo", "Dae-Hee Lee"], "abstract": "Given the superiority of meniscal repair over partial meniscectomy according to biomechanical data, the clinical outcomes of meniscal repair are likely to be better than those of partial meniscectomy for a medial meniscus root tear (MMRT).This review was designed to compare the clinical and radiological results between meniscal repair and partial meniscectomy for MMRTs.

kyphoplasty (BKP), has long been accepted as a minimally invasive surgical intervention for the stabilization of painful vertebral compression fractures. In metastatic compression fracture (MCF), cancer often invades the paravertebral structure and involves the posterior column of the vertebrae.In the present study, we first analyzed how clinical features of MCF affect functional outcomes after VP. Second, we evaluated whether BKP is more beneficial than simple VP (SVP) in MCF.This is a retrospective observational study.Three hundred forty-two patients who underwent VP for painful MCF from solid cancer were included. We excluded MCF from hematopoietic cancer, such as leukemia or multiple myeloma.Pain improvement was evaluated using the visual analog scale (VAS; range: 0-10), and if the VAS score decreased by at least three points the treatment was considered effective. Postoperative change in Karnofsky performance status (KPS) and drug requirement for pain control were also measured as functional outcomes.An institutional database at the National Cancer Center of Korea was searched to identify all patients who underwent VP for painful MCF between March 2002 and September 2013. Demographic data, as well as preoperative and postoperative clinical factors, were collected from patients' medical records. Radiological features, including paravertebral extension of tumors and the extent of three-column involvement, were reviewed from pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs). These clinical and radiological factors were then analyzed for their influence on functional outcomes.The mean preoperative VAS score was 5.8; this improved to a mean of 2.7 after VP. Effective improvement in VAS score (\u22653) was achieved in 206 patients (60%). Patients with radiculopathy, as well as those with involvement of (1) the posterior column or (2) more than four out of six columns, presented with significantly higher pretreatment VAS scores and experienced more effective improvement after treatment (p<.05). Two hundred thirty-eight patients (70%) underwent SVP, whereas the remaining 104 patients underwent BKP. The pretreatment degree of compression was significantly higher in BKP (mean: 47%) than in SVP patients (mean: 30%) (p<.001). However, preoperative VAS scores were not significantly different between the two groups, and the resultant VAS score improvement was also not significantly different. Although BKP patients reported to have a greater chance of more than 3 mL of cement injection (p=.01), the mean amount of cement injected was not different between the two groups. Patients with other bone metastases showed a significantly poorer KPS improvement rate (p=.015).

Comparison of functional radiographs in consecutive patients with low back pain with or without pain on sitting down and relieved by standing up. Objectives. To detect radiologic signs possibly associated with a clinical symptom. Summary of Background Data. No link has been established between increased vertebral mobility and a specific pain pattern or a clinical symptom. Methods. Forty-two patients seen consecutively with low back pain occurring immediately on sitting down and relieved on standing up were compared with 32 controls whose low back pain did not show this pattern. Dynamic radiographs were taken in extension, erect, flexion, and sitting in the painful position. The segments thought to be responsible for the pain were identified by comparing clinical, radiographic, and magnetic resonance data. Endplate angles, rotation, and translation were measured. The radiographs were read twice each by two independent observers. Results. Eighty-six percent (95% confidence interval, 72\u201399%) of the patients with the symptom were female. The segments identified as the source of pain were as follows: L4\u2013L5 in 20 cases and L1\u2013L2 to L3\u2013L4 in 22 cases. Mean rotation of these segments was 13.9 \u00b1 4.5\u00b0 in the patient group versus 7.5 \u00b1 4.3\u00b0 in the control group (P < 0.001). In 14% of the patients (vs. 3% of controls), it exceeded 20\u00b0 (P = 0.13). Anterior or posterior translation >10% was seen in 31% of the patients (vs. 0% of controls;P < 0.001). In flexion, the endplate angle was \u22125.2 \u00b1 3.6\u00b0 (patients) versus 1.2 \u00b1 5.7\u00b0 (controls) (P < 0.01) and <\u22125\u00b0 in 55% of patients versus 12.5% of controls (P < 0.001). This value of <\u22125\u00b0 was associated with marked anterior loss of disc space. Conclusion. Low back pain occurring immediately on sitting down and relieved on standing up was statistically associated with instability (specificity 100%, sensitivity 31%) or marked anterior loss of disc space in flexion (specificity 87%, sensitivity 55%)."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2056004225", "relevance_score": 125.54867, "publication_year": 1966, "title": "Radiological Examination of the Inner Ear of Deaf-Mutes Presenting the Cervico-Oculo-Acusticus Syndrome: With a Summary of Roentgenological and Pathologico-Anatoniical Findings in Other Endogenous Forms of Deafness", "cited_by_count": 35, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Vestibular system", "level": 2, "score": 0.66270435}, {"display_name": "Anatomy", "level": 1, "score": 0.52234876}, {"display_name": "Otosclerosis", "level": 2, "score": 0.48540077}, {"display_name": "Inner ear", "level": 2, "score": 0.41436303}, {"display_name": "Audiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.31558293}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"In": [0], "three": [1], "congenitally": [2], "deaf": [3], "females": [4], "presenting": [5], "the": [6, 25, 49, 65, 68, 75, 87, 93], "\u201ccervico-oculo-acust-icus": [7], "syndrome\u201d": [8], "(perceptive": [9], "deafness": [10], "associated": [11], "with": [12], "fused": [13], "neck": [14], "vertebrae": [15], "and": [16, 22, 29, 89], "spina": [17], "bifida": [18], "occulta": [19], "[Klippel-Fcil": [20], "anomaly]": [21], "abducens": [23], "palsy)": [24], "bony": [26], "labyrinth": [27, 50], "(cochlea": [28], "vestibular": [30, 58], "apparatus)": [31], "appeared": [32], "to": [33, 52], "be": [34, 53], "underdeveloped": [35], "as": [36], "stated": [37], "by": [38], "X-ray": [39], "examination.": [40], "Only": [41], "in": [42, 95], "one": [43, 46], "case,": [44], "at": [45], "side,": [47], "where": [48], "seemed": [51], "least": [54], "underdeveloped,": [55], "a": [56, 84], "normal": [57], "function": [59], "was": [60], "found.": [61], "These": [62], "findings": [63, 91], "support": [64], "opinion": [66], "that": [67], "syndrome": [69], "represents": [70], "an": [71, 134], "entity": [72], "different": [73], "from": [74, 92], "other": [76, 96], "forms": [77, 97], "of": [78, 86, 98], "endogenous": [79, 99], "deafness.": [80], "The": [81], "authors": [82], "give": [83], "summary": [85], "roentgenological": [88], "pathologieo-anatomical": [90], "literature": [94], "deafness.In": [100], "drei": [101], "weiblichen": [102], "Taubstuinmen,": [103], "die": [104, 114, 131, 141, 164], "das": [105, 118, 144], "\u201cZerviko-Okulo-Akustikiis-Syndrom\u201d": [106], "(Innenohrtaublieit": [107], "mit": [108], "Klippel-Feil-Anomalie": [109], "und": [110, 166], "Abduzens-L\u00e4hmung)": [111], "aufwiesen,": [112], "zeigte": [113], "roentgenologische": [115], "Untersuchung,": [116], "dass": [117, 143], "Labyrinth": [119], "(Schnecke": [120], "iind": [121], "Vestibuarapparat)": [122], "unvollst\u00e4ndig": [123], "entwickelt": [124], "war.": [125], "Nur": [126], "bei": [127, 169], "einer": [128, 135], "Patientin": [129], "war": [130], "vestibul\u00e1Ure": [132], "Funktion": [133], "Seite": [136], "erhalten.": [137], "Diese": [138], "Befunde": [139, 168], "best\u00e4tigen": [140], "Auffassung,": [142], "Syndrom": [145], "eine": [146, 161], "selbstiindige,": [147], "von": [148], "den": [149], "anderen": [150, 170], "Formen": [151, 171], "endogener": [152, 172], "Taubheit": [153], "verschiedene": [154], "nosologische": [155], "Einheit": [156], "ist.": [157], "Die": [158], "Verfasser": [159], "geben": [160], "\u00dcbersicht": [162], "\u00fcber": [163], "roentgenologischen": [165], "pathologisch-anatomischen": [167], "Taubheit.": [173]}, "authors": ["L.

Current radiomic signatures suffer from limited reproducibility and generalizability, because most features are dependent on imaging modality and tumor histology, making them sensitive to variations in scan protocol. Here, we propose novel radiological features that are specially designed to ensure compatibility across diverse tissues and imaging contrast. These features provide systematic characterization of tumor morphology and spatial heterogeneity. In an international multi-institution study of 1,682 patients, we discover and validate four unifying imaging subtypes across three malignancies and two major imaging modalities. These tumor subtypes demonstrate distinct molecular characteristics and prognoses after conventional therapies. In advanced lung cancer treated with immunotherapy, one subtype is associated with improved survival and increased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes compared with the others. Deep learning enables automatic tumor segmentation and reproducible subtype identification, which can facilitate practical implementation.

We set out to determine if the radiological parameters can predict histopathological aggressive meningioma, and propose a classification to predict survival and aggressive meningioma behavior.A retrospective review of medical records was conducted for patients who underwent surgical resection of their convexity meningioma. WHO-2007 grading was used for histopathological diagnosis. Preoperative radiologic parameters were analyzed, each parameter was scored 0 or 1. Signal intensity on diffusion weighted MRI (DWI) (hyperintensity=1), heterogeneity on T1-weighted gadolinium enhanced MRI (heterogeneity=1), disruption of arachnoid at brain-tumor interface=1 and peritumoral edema (PTE) on T2-weighted MRI (presence of PTE=1) and tumor shape (irregular shape=1). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine association of radiological parameters to histopathological grading. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models were used to determine the association of scoring system to overall survival and progression free survival (PFS). Reliability of the classification was tested using Kappa co-efficient analysis.Hyperintensity on DWI, disruption of arachnoid at brain-tumor interface, PTE, heterogenicitiy on T1-weighted enhanced MRI and irregular tumor shape were independent predictors of non-grade I meningioma. Mean follow-up period was 94.6 months (range, 12-117 months). Median survival and PFS in groups-I, II and III was 114.1\u00b11.2 and 115.7\u00b1 0.8, 88\u00b1 3.3 and 58.5\u00b13.9, 43.2\u00b1 5.1 and 18.2\u00b11.7 months respectively.

Although open surgical exploration remains the standard of care for determination of fusion, it is impractical in most clinical situations. Static radiographs have long been used as a practical method of fusion assessment, but they tend to significantly overestimate the presence of a solid fusion. Dynamic radiographs improve accuracy but limitations include measurement reliability, disagreement on allowable motion, and the two-dimensional nature of radiographs. Ultimately, lack of movement at a fused segment does not confirm fusion. Radiostereometric analysis further improves accuracy; however, methodological demands make it largely impractical for routine use. CT is now widely accepted as the standard for noninvasive assessment of spinal fusion. Fine-cut imaging, multiplanar reconstruction, and metal artifact reduction have increased the ability to assess fusion on CT. However, significant concerns remain regarding the effects of high radiation exposure. Although MRI is appealing, its utility in assessing fusion remains unproven. Understanding the limitations of each technique allows judicious use of radiology in the assessment of spinal fusion."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2104977442", "relevance_score": 238.74475, "publication_year": 1991, "title": "Three-dimensional display in nuclear medicine and radiology.", "cited_by_count": 34, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Rendering (computer graphics)", "level": 2, "score": 0.77459955}, {"display_name": "Volume rendering", "level": 3, "score": 0.6329462}, {"display_name": "Computed tomography", "level": 2, "score": 0.4589234}, {"display_name": "Medical physics", "level": 1, "score": 0.44178355}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.41177762}, {"display_name": "Nuclear medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.3879059}, {"display_name": "Computer graphics (images)", "level": 1, "score": 0.37843576}, {"display_name": "Artificial intelligence", "level": 1, "score": 0.33295527}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"As": [0], "three-dimensional": [1, 25, 50], "displays": [2], "become": [3], "more": [4], "common": [5], "in": [6, 54, 70], "nuclear": [7, 71], "medicine": [8], "and": [9, 34, 38, 59, 75], "radiology,": [10], "it": [11], "is": [12, 43], "important": [13], "to": [14, 45, 49], "know": [15], "when": [16], "they": [17], "should": [18], "be": [19], "employed.": [20], "Selection": [21], "of": [22, 31, 66], "the": [23, 32], "appropriate": [24], "rendering": [26, 51, 61], "method": [27], "requires": [28], "an": [29, 47], "understanding": [30], "techniques": [33], "both": [35], "their": [36], "advantages": [37], "limitations.": [39], "This": [40], "review": [41], "article": [42], "intended": [44], "provide": [46], "introduction": [48], "techniques.": [52], "Methods": [53], "surface": [55, 57], "mapping,": [56], "rendering,": [58], "volume": [60], "are": [62], "presented,": [63], "with": [64], "discussion": [65], "specific": [67], "clinical": [68], "applications": [69], "medicine,": [72], "computed": [73], "tomography,": [74], "magnetic": [76], "resonance": [77], "imaging.": [78]}, "authors": ["Jerold W.

We illustrate the feasibility of a patient portal that automatically structures and integrates radiology reports with corresponding imaging studies according to several information orientations tailored for the layperson. Methods The imaging patient portal is composed of an image processing module for the creation of a timeline that illustrates the progression of disease, a natural language processing module to extract salient concepts from radiology reports (73% accuracy, F1 score of 0.67), and an interactive user interface navigable by an imaging findings list. The portal was developed as a Java-based web application and is demonstrated for patients with brain cancer. Results and discussion The system was exhibited at an international radiology conference to solicit feedback from a diverse group of healthcare professionals. There was wide support for educating patients about their imaging studies, and an appreciation for the informatics tools used to simplify images and reports for consumer interpretation. Primary concerns included the possibility of patients misunderstanding their results, as well as worries regarding accidental improper disclosure of medical information. Conclusions Radiologic imaging composes a significant amount of the evidence used to make diagnostic and treatment decisions, yet there are few tools for explaining this information to patients. The proposed radiology patient portal provides a framework for organizing radiologic results into several information orientations to support patient education."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2151288993", "relevance_score": 224.5621, "publication_year": 1982, "title": "Assessment of Congenital Neurovesical Dysfunction by Combined Urodynamic and Radiological Studies", "cited_by_count": 34, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Radiological weapon", "level": 2, "score": 0.8417946}, {"display_name": "Urodynamic studies", "level": 3, "score": 0.8367268}, {"display_name": "Urine", "level": 2, "score": 0.41122264}, {"display_name": "Urology", "level": 1, "score": 0.40637302}, {"display_name": "Internal medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.28518432}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.26193154}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Summary\u2014": [0], "The": [1, 22, 65], "findings": [2], "of": [3, 13, 29, 56], "combined,": [4], "simultaneous,": [5], "urodynamic": [6], "and": [7, 52, 62, 75], "radiological": [8], "studies": [9], "in": [10, 27, 54, 69, 78], "a": [11], "series": [12], "109": [14], "patients": [15], "with": [16], "congenital": [17], "neurovesical": [18], "dysfunction": [19], "are": [20, 24, 76], "described.": [21], "results": [23], "classified": [25], "firstly": [26], "terms": [28, 55], "voiding": [30], "activity,": [31], "that": [32], "is": [33], "whether": [34], "this": [35], "occurred": [36], "only": [37, 42], "by": [38, 43, 49], "involuntary": [39], "detrusor": [40], "contractions,": [41], "abdominal": [44], "expression": [45], "or": [46, 48], "straining": [47], "both": [50], "means,": [51], "secondly": [53], "the": [57], "bladder's": [58], "ability": [59], "to": [60], "store": [61], "void": [63], "urine.": [64], "reasons": [66], "for": [67], "failures": [68], "these": [70], "latter": [71], "respects": [72], "were": [73], "variable": [74], "discussed": [77], "detail.": [79]}, "authors": ["A.

Recent changes to the World Health Organization classification of soft-tissue tumors include the movement of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) into the soft-tissue tumor classification. GIST is the most common intraperitoneal sarcoma. Liposarcoma is the most common retroperitoneal sarcoma, and leiomyosarcoma is the second most common. GIST, liposarcoma, and leiomyosarcoma account for the majority of sarcomas encountered in the abdomen and pelvis and are discussed in part 1 of this article. Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (previously called malignant fibrous histiocytoma), dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, solitary fibrous tumor, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, extraskeletal chondro-osseous sarcomas, vascular sarcomas, and sarcomas of uncertain differentiation uncommonly arise in the abdomen and pelvis and the abdominal wall. Although these lesions are rare sarcomas and their imaging features overlap, familiarity with the locations where they occur and their imaging features is important so they can be diagnosed accurately. The anatomic location and clinical history are important factors in the differential diagnosis of these lesions because metastasis, more-common sarcomas, borderline fibroblastic proliferations (such as desmoid tumors), and endometriosis have imaging findings that overlap with those of these uncommon sarcomas.

An understanding of the mechanisms of injury to the major airways and the predictable resultant patterns of air leak should ensure that such lesions are not overlooked in patients who will usually have sustained multisystem trauma."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W1987366323", "relevance_score": 212.75546, "publication_year": 1990, "title": "Anatomical and Radiologic Studies on the Lumbosacral Meningovertebral Ligaments of Humans", "cited_by_count": 34, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Anatomy", "level": 1, "score": 0.8791178}, {"display_name": "Lumbosacral joint", "level": 2, "score": 0.6990907}, {"display_name": "Posterior longitudinal ligament", "level": 3, "score": 0.68155295}, {"display_name": "Ligament", "level": 2, "score": 0.6302905}, {"display_name": "Sagittal plane", "level": 2, "score": 0.5968834}, {"display_name": "Spinal canal", "level": 3, "score": 0.57632333}, {"display_name": "Cadaveric spasm", "level": 2, "score": 0.53084075}, {"display_name": "Anterior longitudinal ligament", "level": 3, "score": 0.51390123}, {"display_name": "Calcification", "level": 2, "score": 0.48258817}, {"display_name": "Dissection (medical)", "level": 2, "score": 0.44919583}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Summary": [0], "Among": [1], "the": [2, 7, 16, 31, 56, 67, 71, 74, 77, 85, 90, 94, 98, 110, 116, 119, 134, 144, 155, 173, 199], "minor": [3], "soft": [4], "structures": [5], "of": [6, 60, 70, 76, 93, 118, 124, 143, 172, 198], "lumbosacral": [8, 145], "spinal": [9, 78, 174], "canal": [10], "that": [11, 55, 158], "computed": [12, 131], "tomography": [13, 132], "can": [14, 177], "visualize,": [15], "meningovertebral": [17, 164], "ligaments": [18, 57, 111, 123, 165], "have": [19, 35], "been": [20, 53], "neglected.": [21], "There": [22], "are": [23, 112], "no": [24], "specific": [25], "reports": [26], "on": [27, 48, 140], "this": [28, 184], "subject,": [29], "and": [30, 40, 62, 102, 126, 183], "only": [32], "knowledge": [33], "we": [34], "comes": [36], "from": [37, 89, 189], "very": [38, 181], "ancient": [39], "nearly": [41], "forgotten": [42], "anatomical": [43], "works.": [44], "From": [45], "our": [46], "studies": [47], "cadaveric": [49], "specimens,": [50], "it": [51, 159], "has": [52], "confirmed": [54], "consist": [58], "segmentally": [59], "ventral": [61, 86], "lateral": [63], "fibrous": [64], "bands,": [65], "connecting": [66], "outer": [68], "surface": [69], "dura": [72], "to": [73, 97, 106], "endostium": [75], "canal.": [79, 175], "The": [80, 163], "most": [81, 138], "characteristic": [82], "component": [83], "is": [84, 161], "one,": [87], "running": [88], "anterior": [91], "wall": [92], "dural": [95, 120], "sac": [96], "posterior": [99, 200], "longitudinal": [100, 201], "ligament": [101, 135], "vertebral": [103], "endostium.": [104], "Due": [105], "their": [107], "anchoring": [108], "function,": [109], "significantly": [113], "developed": [114], "at": [115], "level": [117], "conus": [121], "(sacrodural": [122], "Trolard": [125], "Hofmann).": [127], "On": [128], "in": [129, 169], "vivo": [130], "studies,": [133], "image": [136], "appears": [137], "commonly": [139], "transverse": [141], "scanograms": [142], "segments": [146], "as": [147], "a": [148], "median": [149], "sagittal": [150], "septum,": [151], "easily": [152], "identifiable": [153], "when": [154], "extradural": [156], "fat": [157], "crosses": [160], "abundant.": [162], "may": [166], "be": [167, 187], "implicated": [168], "pathological": [170], "conditions": [171], "They": [176], "calcify": [178], "singly,": [179], "though": [180], "rarely,": [182], "process": [185], "must": [186], "differentiated": [188], "degenerative": [190], "marginal": [191], "spurs,": [192], "calcific": [193], "disc": [194], "herniation,": [195], "circumscribed": [196], "calcification": [197], "ligament,": [202], "or": [203], "partial": [204], "diplomyelia.": [205]}, "authors": ["R Scapinelli"], "abstract": "Summary Among the minor soft structures of the lumbosacral spinal canal that computed tomography can visualize, the meningovertebral ligaments have been neglected. There are no specific reports on this subject, and the only knowledge we have comes from very ancient and nearly forgotten anatomical works. From our studies on cadaveric specimens, it has been confirmed that the ligaments consist segmentally of ventral and lateral fibrous bands, connecting the outer surface of the dura to the endostium of the spinal canal. The most characteristic component is the ventral one, running from the anterior wall of the dural sac to the posterior longitudinal ligament and vertebral endostium. Due to their anchoring function, the ligaments are significantly developed at the level of the dural conus (sacrodural ligaments of Trolard and Hofmann). On in vivo computed tomography studies, the ligament image appears most commonly on transverse scanograms of the lumbosacral segments as a median sagittal septum, easily identifiable when the extradural fat that it crosses is abundant. The meningovertebral ligaments may be implicated in pathological conditions of the spinal canal. They can calcify singly, though very rarely, and this process must be differentiated from degenerative marginal spurs, calcific disc herniation, circumscribed calcification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, or partial diplomyelia."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2906356243", "relevance_score": 209.83914, "publication_year": 2019, "title": "Neurophysiological, radiological and

To date, the pathophysiology of MS fatigue remains poorly understood and little is known about the relationship between this symptom and various clinical, neuropsychological, neurophysiological and radiological data. The aim of this work is to understand the underlying mechanisms of MS fatigue by means of a multidimensional evaluation. Methods Fatigued (n = 21) and non-fatigued (n = 17) MS patients were enrolled based on the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale. They underwent clinical (disability score and disease duration), neuropsychological (scales of depression, anxiety, alexithymia, sleep, and Symbol Digit Modalities Test), neurophysiological (corticospinal excitability measures using transcranial magnetic stimulation), and radiological (volume-based morphometric magnetic resonance imaging) evaluations. The normality of data distribution was studied by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Group comparison was performed using the Mann-Whitney or Student t test (quantitative data) and the exact Fisher's test (qualitative data). Correlation analysis was done using Pearson and Spearman tests. Results Fatigued patients had higher depression (p = 0.02), anxiety (p = 0.02) and alexithymia (p = 0.04) scores compared to non-fatigued patients. On the neurophysiological and radiological evaluations, they also had higher short-interval intracortical inhibition (p = 0.04), larger caudate nuclei (p \u2264 0.01) and smaller left parietal cortex (p = 0.01). These findings were in line with the correlation analyses results. Conclusion The neuropsychological findings suggest common underlying mechanisms as well as bi-directional relationships between fatigue and each of anxiety, depression, and alexithymia. The neurophysiological findings may reflect maladaptive neuroplasticity processes and an aberrant GABAergic transmission in the generation of fatigue. The radiological findings could be interpreted in the light of the \u2018dysfunctional hypertrophy\u2019 or \u2018compensatory hypertrophy\u2019 hypotheses."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2078702639", "relevance_score": 208.29189, "publication_year": 2004, "title": "The trigeminal nerve and ganglion: an anatomical, histological, and radiological study addressing the transtrigeminal approach", "cited_by_count": 34, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Anatomy", "level": 1, "score": 0.8211867}, {"display_name": "Ganglion", "level": 2, "score": 0.70472485}, {"display_name": "Trigeminal ganglion", "level": 3, "score": 0.69633496}, {"display_name": "Trigeminal neuralgia", "level": 2, "score": 0.58231014}, {"display_name": "Skull", "level": 2, "score": 0.52419657}, {"display_name": "Trigeminal nerve", "level": 2, "score": 0.5089402}, {"display_name": "Cisterna", "level": 4, "score": 0.506826}, {"display_name": "Cadaveric spasm", "level": 2, "score": 0.4736104}, {"display_name": "Mandibular nerve", "level": 3, "score": 0.4718599}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"The": [0, 62, 177, 199], "transtrigeminal": [1, 38], "route": [2], "with": [3, 168, 266], "splitting": [4], "of": [5, 21, 28, 44, 90, 111, 120, 155, 225, 232, 268, 272], "the": [6, 18, 22, 26, 29, 32, 37, 41, 45, 49, 53, 74, 87, 91, 137, 153, 156, 169, 171, 174, 204, 223, 226, 229, 233, 236, 246, 255, 269, 273], "trigeminal": [7, 46, 54], "ganglion": [8, 96, 129], "(TG)": [9], "is": [10, 109, 258], "a": [11, 123, 128], "skull": [12], "base": [13, 27], "approach": [14, 39], "used": [15], "to": [16, 144, 165, 244, 253], "expose": [17], "posteromedial": [19, 270], "part": [20, 271], "cavernous": [23], "sinus": [24], "(CS),": [25], "TG,": [30, 51], "and": [31, 52, 60, 93, 114, 173, 214, 228, 261], "petrolingual": [33], "ligament": [34], "(PLL).To": [35], "verify": [36], "(TTA),": [40], "3": [42, 118, 179, 184, 201], "divisions": [43, 185, 231], "nerve": [47], "(TN),": [48], "so-called": [50, 95, 247], "root": [55], "were": [56, 83], "analyzed": [57], "anatomically,": [58], "histologically,": [59], "radiologically.": [61], "anatomic": [63], "study": [64], "was": [65, 97], "performed": [66, 98], "bilaterally": [67], "in": [68, 263], "5": [69, 100], "cadaveric": [70], "head": [71], "specimens.": [72], "For": [73], "histologic": [75], "study,": [76], "6": [77, 162], "TN": [78, 92, 108, 157, 234], "specimens": [79], "removed": [80], "from": [81], "cadavers": [82], "used.": [84], "In": [85, 148], "addition,": [86], "radiologic": [88], "demonstration": [89], "its": [94], "on": [99], "cases": [101, 265], "by": [102], "magnetic": [103], "resonance": [104], "imaging": [105], "(MRI)": [106], "scan.The": [107], "composed": [110], "linear,": [112], "crossing,": [113], "connecting": [115], "rootlets.": [116], "These": [117], "types": [119], "rootlets": [121, 224], "indicate": [122], "plexiform": [124], "constitution": [125], "rather": [126], "than": [127], "even": [130], "though": [131], "there": [132], "are": [133, 186, 206], "ganglionic": [134], "cells.": [135], "Consequently,": [136], "term": [138], "\"trigeminal": [139, 248], "plexus\"": [140], "may": [141], "be": [142, 159], "preferred": [143], "describe": [145], "this": [146], "network.": [147], "our": [149], "new": [150], "proposed": [151], "classification,": [152], "segments": [154, 180, 202], "can": [158], "divided": [160], "into": [161, 183], "portions": [163], "according": [164], "their": [166], "relationship": [167], "brainstem,": [170], "cisterns,": [172], "bone": [175], "structures.": [176], "first": [178], "before": [181], "separating": [182], "(1)": [187], "pontine,": [188], "(2)": [189], "cisternal": [190], "(preganglionic": [191], "or": [192, 197, 210, 239, 250], "preplexal),": [193], "(3)": [194], "gasserian": [195, 237], "(ganglionic": [196, 238], "plexal).": [198], "last": [200], "after": [203], "division": [205], "(4)": [207], "preforamino-fissural": [208], "(postganglionic": [209], "postplexal),": [211], "(5)": [212], "foramino-fissural,": [213], "(6)": [215], "extracranial": [216], "(postforamino-fissural).": [217], "A": [218], "loose": [219], "connective": [220], "tissue": [221], "along": [222], "maxillary": [227], "mandibular": [230], "at": [235], "plexal)": [240], "segment": [241], "enabled": [242], "us": [243], "split": [245], "ganglion\"": [249, 252], "\"gasserian": [251], "perform": [254], "TTA.The": [256], "TTA": [257], "possible,": [259], "useful,": [260], "necessary": [262], "selected": [264], "invasion": [267], "CS.": [274]}, "authors": ["Ibrahim M.

The anatomic study was performed bilaterally in 5 cadaveric head specimens. For the histologic study, 6 TN specimens removed from cadavers were used. In addition, the radiologic demonstration of the TN and its so-called ganglion was performed on 5 cases by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.The TN is composed of linear, crossing, and connecting rootlets. These 3 types of rootlets indicate a plexiform constitution rather than a ganglion even though there are ganglionic cells. Consequently, the term \"trigeminal plexus\" may be preferred to describe this network. In our new proposed classification, the segments of the TN can be divided into 6 portions according to their relationship with the brainstem, the cisterns, and the bone structures.

The purpose of the study was to examine the role of interbody fixation vs pedicle fixation in transverse lumbar fusion and to assess treated and adjacent disc space height changes over time. One hundred patients who underwent PLIF and noninstrumented transverse process fusion (n = 55) or instrumented PLF (n = 45) between 1996 and 1998 were evaluated retrospectively. Outpatient charts and follow-up films were reviewed. Bone fusion was determined using Brantigan and Steffee's classification and clinical outcome by the Prolo scale. Disc space heights at the fusion and adjacent levels were measured. Analysis of variance and \u03c72 statistical techniques were used for data analysis. Disc space height was increased and better maintained in PLIF patients. PLIF resulted in a nonsignificant tendency toward higher fusion rates. No differences in clinical and functional outcomes were found between the groups. There was no correlation between preservation of disc space height and clinical outcome.

Methods Primary tumor and lymph node features of HPV\u2010positive and HPV\u2010negative OPCs from 2008 to 2013 were compared on pretreatment CT/MRI. Intrarater/interrater concordance was assessed. Multivariable analyses identified factors associated with HPV\u2010positivity to be used in nomogram construction. Results Compared to HPV\u2010negative (n = 194), HPV\u2010positive (n = 488) tumors were more exophytic (73% vs 63%; p = .02) with well\u2010defined border (58% vs 47%; p = .033) and smaller axial dimensions; lymph node involvement predominated (89% vs 69%; p &lt; .001) with cystic appearance (45% vs 32%; p = .009) but similar topography. Intrarater/interrater concordance varied (fair to excellent). Nomograms combining clinical (age, sex, smoking pack\u2010years, subsite, T/N classification) and/or radiologic (nonnecrotic tumor and cystic lymph node) features were used to weigh the likelihood of HPV\u2010driven tumors (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.84).

Peer-reviewed primary studies that investigated the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound for intussusception in children were included. The study is reported using Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies (PRISMA-DTA). Meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound for intussusception was conducted using the random-effects bivariate model. Subgroup analysis (POCUS vs RADUS) was also performed. Meta-regression was utilized to determine if the diagnostic accuracy between POCUS and RADUS was significantly different.Thirty studies (n = 5249) were included in the meta-analysis. Ultrasonography for intussusception has a sensitivity: 0.98 (95% CI: 0.96-0.98), specificity: 0.98 (95% CI: 0.95-0.99), positive likelihood ratio: 43.8 (95% CI: 18.0-106.7) and negative likelihood ratio: 0.03 (95% CI: 0.02-0.04), with an area under ROC (AUROC) curve of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.98-1.00). Meta-regression suggested no significant difference in the diagnostic accuracy for intussusception between POCUS and RADUS (AUROC: 0.95 vs 1.00, p = 0.128).Current evidence suggested POCUS has a high diagnostic accuracy for intussusception not significantly different from that of RADUS."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2062011989", "relevance_score": 199.34296, "publication_year": 2012, "title": "Efficacy of clinical and radiological methods to identify second mesiobuccal canals in maxillary first molars", "cited_by_count": 34, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Cone beam computed tomography", "level": 3, "score": 0.72542244}, {"display_name": "Molar", "level": 2, "score": 0.706501}, {"display_name": "Dentistry", "level": 1, "score": 0.6468952}, {"display_name": "Radiography", "level": 2, "score": 0.5734426}, {"display_name": "Orthodontics", "level": 1, "score": 0.5052951}, {"display_name": "Radiological weapon", "level": 2, "score": 0.4581103}, {"display_name": "Root canal", "level": 2, "score": 0.43183947}, {"display_name": "Computed tomography", "level": 2, "score": 0.25992343}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"The": [0, 28, 149], "success": [1], "of": [2, 9, 24, 30, 38, 64, 115, 151, 171, 201, 233], "endodontic": [3, 62], "treatment": [4, 63], "depends": [5], "on": [6], "the": [7, 22, 36, 72, 113, 172, 199, 237], "identification": [8], "all": [10, 107], "root": [11], "canals.": [12], "Technological": [13], "advances": [14], "have": [15], "facilitated": [16], "this": [17, 31], "process": [18], "as": [19, 21], "well": [20], "assessment": [23, 211], "internal": [25], "anatomical": [26], "variations.": [27], "aim": [29], "study": [32], "was": [33], "to": [34, 71, 158, 167, 203], "compare": [35], "efficacy": [37], "clinical": [39, 59, 78, 85, 87, 94, 121, 132, 210, 256], "and": [40, 58, 77, 93, 131, 136, 144, 185, 229, 255], "radiological": [41], "methods": [42, 235], "in": [43, 49, 101, 106, 117, 123, 128, 141, 198, 242], "locating": [44], "second": [45, 240], "mesiobuccal": [46, 173], "canals": [47, 174, 206], "(MB2)": [48], "maxillary": [50, 66], "first": [51, 67], "molars.Fifty": [52], "patients": [53], "referred": [54], "for": [55], "analysis;": [56, 60, 75, 79, 86], "access": [57, 76], "cone-beam": [61, 80], "their": [65], "molars": [68], "were": [69, 176], "submitted": [70], "following": [73, 134], "assessments:": [74], "computed": [81], "tomography": [82], "(CBCT);": [83], "post-CBCT": [84], "analysis": [88, 95, 111, 122, 127, 133, 190], "using": [89, 137], "an": [90, 138, 215], "operating": [91, 139, 216, 251], "microscope;": [92], "after": [96], "Start": [97, 152, 253], "X": [98, 153, 254], "ultrasonic": [99, 154], "inserts": [100, 155], "teeth": [102, 162], "with": [103, 163, 209, 212], "negative": [104], "results": [105], "previous": [108], "analyses.Periapical": [109], "radiographic": [110], "revealed": [112], "presence": [114], "MB2": [116, 164, 205], "four": [118], "(8%)": [119], "teeth,": [120, 147], "25": [124], "(50%),": [125], "CBCT": [126, 135, 202], "27": [129, 142], "(54%)": [130, 143], "microscope": [140], "29": [145], "(58%)": [146], "respectively.": [148], "use": [150, 232], "allowed": [156], "one": [157], "detect": [159, 204], "two": [160], "additional": [161], "(62%).": [165], "According": [166], "Vertucci's": [168], "classification": [169], "48%": [170], "found": [175, 224], "type": [177, 180, 183, 187], "I,": [178], "28%": [179], "II,": [181], "18%": [182], "IV": [184], "6%": [186], "V.": [188], "Statistical": [189], "showed": [191], "no": [192], "significant": [193, 219], "differences": [194], "(p": [195, 221], ">": [196], "0.5)": [197], "ability": [200], "when": [207], "compared": [208], "or": [213], "without": [214, 246], "microscope.": [217], "A": [218], "difference": [220, 248], "<": [222], "0.001)was": [223], "only": [225], "between": [226], "periapical": [227], "radiography": [228], "clinical/CBCT": [230], "evaluations.Combined": [231], "different": [234], "increased": [236], "detection": [238], "ofthe": [239], "canal": [241], "MB": [243], "roots,": [244], "but": [245], "statistical": [247], "among": [249], "CBCT,": [250], "microscope,": [252], "analysis.": [257]}, "authors": ["Allan Abuabara", "Flares Baratto\u2010Filho", "Juliana Aguiar Anele", "Denise Piotto Leonardi", "Manoel Dami\u00e3o Sousa\u2010Neto"], "abstract": "The success of endodontic treatment depends on the identification of all root canals. Technological advances have facilitated this process as well as the assessment of internal anatomical variations. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of clinical and radiological methods in locating second mesiobuccal canals (MB2) in maxillary first molars.Fifty patients referred for analysis; access and clinical analysis; cone-beam endodontic treatment of their maxillary first molars were submitted to the following assessments: analysis; access and clinical analysis; cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT); post-CBCT clinical analysis; clinical analysis using an operating microscope; and clinical analysis after Start X ultrasonic inserts in teeth with negative results in all previous analyses.Periapical radiographic analysis revealed the presence of MB2 in four (8%) teeth, clinical analysis in 25 (50%), CBCT analysis in 27 (54%) and clinical analysis following CBCT and using an operating microscope in 27 (54%) and 29 (58%) teeth, respectively. The use of Start X ultrasonic inserts allowed one to detect two additional teeth with MB2 (62%). According to Vertucci's classification 48% of the mesiobuccal canals found were type I, 28% type II, 18% type IV and 6% type V. Statistical analysis showed no significant differences (p > 0.5) in the ability of CBCT to detect MB2 canals when compared with clinical assessment with or without an operating microscope. A significant difference (p < 0.001)was found only between periapical radiography and clinical/CBCT evaluations.Combined use of different methods increased the detection ofthe second canal in MB roots, but without statistical difference among CBCT, operating microscope, Start X and clinical analysis."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2006768297", "relevance_score": 198.55765, "publication_year": 2010, "title": "Where Failures Occur in the Imaging Care Cycle: Lessons From the Radiology Events Register", "cited_by_count": 34, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Medical imaging", "level": 2, "score": 0.5645151}, {"display_name": "Patient safety", "level": 3, "score": 0.5122239}, {"display_name": "Anesthesiology", "level": 2, "score": 0.49103928}, {"display_name": "Scale (ratio)", "level": 2, "score": 0.4348175}, {"display_name": "Reliability (semiconductor)", "level": 3, "score": 0.42895252}, {"display_name": "Health care", "level": 2, "score": 0.42183626}, {"display_name": "Medical emergency", "level": 1, "score": 0.42093456}, {"display_name": "Medical physics", "level": 1, "score": 0.37891752}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.28618622}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Adverse": [0], "events": [1], "contribute": [2], "to": [3, 51, 83, 94, 118, 131, 158], "significant": [4], "patient": [5], "morbidity": [6], "and": [7, 13, 57, 67, 87, 101, 103, 135, 146], "mortality": [8], "on": [9], "a": [10, 19, 40], "global": [11], "scale,": [12], "this": [14, 85, 88, 112], "has": [15, 72, 80], "been": [16, 81], "documented": [17, 108], "in": [18, 34, 64, 78, 116, 142], "number": [20], "of": [21, 30, 43, 162], "international": [22], "studies.": [23], "Despite": [24], "this,": [25], "there": [26], "is": [27, 39, 49, 105, 113], "limited": [28], "understanding": [29], "medical": [31, 90, 96], "imaging's": [32], "involvement": [33], "such": [35], "events.": [36], "Incident": [37], "reporting": [38, 125], "key": [41], "feature": [42], "high-reliability": [44], "organizations": [45], "because,": [46], "understandably,": [47], "it": [48], "essential": [50], "know": [52], "where": [53, 95, 138], "things": [54], "go": [55], "wrong": [56], "why": [58], "as": [59, 93], "the": [60, 74, 127, 143, 155, 160, 163], "very": [61], "first": [62], "step": [63], "formulating": [65], "preventative": [66], "corrective": [68], "strategies.": [69], "Although": [70], "anesthesiology": [71], "led": [73], "way,": [75], "health": [76], "care": [77], "general": [79], "slow": [82], "adopt": [84], "technique,": [86], "includes": [89], "imaging.": [91], "Knowledge": [92], "imaging": [97, 144, 164], "incidents": [98, 149], "are": [99, 140], "initiated": [100], "detected,": [102], "why,": [104], "not": [106], "well": [107], "or": [109], "appreciated,": [110], "although": [111], "critical": [114], "information": [115], "relation": [117], "quality": [119], "improvement.": [120], "Using": [121], "an": [122], "online": [123], "radiology": [124], "system,": [126], "authors": [128, 156], "therefore": [129], "sought": [130, 157], "gain": [132], "further": [133], "insight": [134], "also": [136], "ascertain": [137], "failures": [139], "located": [141], "cycle,": [145], "whether": [147], "different": [148, 152], "sources": [150], "provide": [151], "information.": [153], "Last,": [154], "examine": [159], "resilience": [161], "system": [165], "using": [166], "these": [167], "incident": [168], "data.": [169]}, "authors": ["D Neil Jones", "Matthew J.

Present article is a review of radiological features of hepatocellular carcinoma on various imaging modalities. With the advancement in imaging techniques, biopsy is rarely needed for diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), unlike other malignancies. Imaging is useful not only for diagnosis but also for surveillance, therapy and assessing response to treatment. The classical and the atypical radiological features of HCC have been described. Present day radiology plays an essential role in evaluation and treatment together with surveillance of hepatocellular carcinoma. The detailed information regarding the various stages, lesion description, loco-regional disease infiltration or distant disease spread can be ascertained. It is essential to use the imaging modalities deliberately and liberally to confidently detect early lesions; thereby allowing effective and curative treatment options for HCC. The liver lesions are classified into the following as per Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS).1Yu N.C. Chaudhari V.

Lesions should have following features to meet criteriaLesions between 1 and 2 cm must be hypervascular on arterial phase imaging, and demonstrate portal vein/delayed phase washout and pseudocapsule enhancement. If both washout and pseudocapsule enhancement are not present, they must demonstrate growth on serial imaging or confirmed on histology.2Luo W. Numata K.

If no washout or pseudocapsule enhancement, lesion must demonstrate growth on serial imaging.Lesions less than 1 cm are indeterminate (and thus, not eligible to be considered as HCC). Hepatic artery is the primary feeder to the HCC. It is important to optimize the protocol of imaging based upon the characteristic arterial phase enhancement of HCC. The avid contrast enhancement in arterial phase of the image acquisition is crucial to radiological diagnosis of HCC.4Luca A. Caruso S. Milazzo M. et al.Multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT) for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhotic candidates for liver transplantation: prevalence of radiological vascular patterns and histological correlation with liver explants.Eur Radiol. 2010 Apr; 20: 898-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar With the evolution of dual source/dual energy and 32 channels MRI imaging, the detection of lesions smaller than even 1.0 cm is possible, especially on arterial phases. If the lesions are larger than 1.0 cm, than in addition to arterial phase imaging, a portal-delayed phase washout can be appreciated and is characteristic of HCC. From the initial three phase imaging (triple phase study) a recommendation of image acquisition for multiple sequences of the arterial phase is important (four-phase CT). This increases the sensitivity for smaller lesions with a profound neovascularization, circumventing the differences in blood flow kinetics and characteristics of the tumor. Some large lesions may be hypovascular on arterial phase and may show a heterogenous delayed enhancement. The term rapid washout is presence of hypodensity or hypointensity of the lesion as compared to rest of the liver on portovenous or delayed phases, and has a specificity of 95\u201396% for diagnosis of HCC.4Luca A.

On CT, the capsule usually is hypodense and on MRI hyperintense on T1W and T2W. Some studies suggested that, low-grade HCCs are well encapsulated and the efficacy of TACE treatment is better in HCCs with a capsule. Vascular invasion is common in large and/or high-grade tumors. Thrombosis of the portal vein, is seen 44\u201362.8% of large HCC. Thrombosis may be because of the tumor invasion or non-tumoral. The management strategy for the thrombus due to tumor and a bland thrombus are different and critical. Tumor thrombus is usually identified in contiguity of the primary tumor and tends to enlarge the adjacent vessels due to tumor encroachment.Tabled 1Tumor thrombusNon-tumor thrombusTumor in continuity with the vessel thrombosisThis may not be presentExpansileNon-expansileTumor thrombus enhances post contrast, especially in arterial phaseNo thrombus enhancementTends to have neovascularityNo neovascularityThrombosed vessel appears largerAppears shrunken/normal size Open table in a new tab The behavior of the tumor thrombus is identical to that of the parent tumor, exhibiting post contrast enhancement, and a high T2 intensity together with a washout and a restricted diffusion. There is a propensity for a higher ADC (apparent diffusion co-efficient) in the bland thrombus than HCC, more than the tumor thrombus itself. The large HCCs have a combination of areas of variable contrast enhancement and inherent signal intensity in T1 and T2 sequences which gives a mosaic appearance. On histopathology, there are multiple confluent areas of tumors, which have a variable cellular differentiation, adjacent parenchymal fibrosis, scarring, necrosis together with hemorrhage and septations, which explains the heterogeneous appearance. Based upon the nature of contrast uptake in the arterial phase, the liver lesions can be hypovascular and hypervascular in relation to the normal hepatic parenchyma. Sometimes, there is a delayed contrast enhancement, without any washout. Such lesions may be focal nodular hyperplasia, hemangiomas, hepatic adenoma, hypervascular metastases are of transient hepatic enhancement difference. Some HCC may not show washout with conventional imaging and would either need newer imaging modalities like Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI and/or biopsy for confirmation of diagnosis.7Tan C.H. Low S.C. Thng C.H. APASL and AASLD consensus guidelines on imaging diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma: a review.Int J Hepatol. 2011; 2011: 519783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar Hypovascular liver lesions are frequently identified and most likely metastases. About 10% of HCC are hypovascular. Delayed enhancement is found in malignant tumors like cholangiocarcinoma. Poorly demarcated, heterogeneously diffuse, infiltrating lesions representing HCCs are not uncommon. On MRI such lesions have a variable but homogenous T1-T2W appearances (T1 hypointensity and T2 hyperintensity).8Marrero J.A. Hussain H.K. Nghiem H.V. Umar R. Fontana R.J. Lok A.S. Improving the prediction of hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhotic patients with an arterially-enhancing liver mass.Liver Transpl. 2005 Mar; 11: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar Diffuse infiltrating HCCs demonstrate hypoenhancement or nodular patchy enhancement on arterial and heterogenous reticular enhancement on delayed contrast phases. Portal vein thrombosis is common in such diffuse infiltrating HCC (5\u201344%). The overall reported prevalence is upto 54% of all HCC especially in oriental countries. Fibrolamellar HCCs are major differentials. HCCs in non-cirrhotic livers are larger, well-demarcated, solitary lesions with large areas of necrosis and are usually diagnosed at a later stage. Such HCCs uncommonly may show calcification, fibrosis and central scar.1Yu N.C. Chaudhari V.

Chaudhari V. Raman S.S. et al.CT and MRI improve detection of hepatocellular carcinoma, compared with ultrasound alone, in patients with cirrhosis.Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2011 Feb; 9: 161-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar Anomalous blood supply gives rise to such lesions, and are seen in non malignant condition as well. These THADs/THIDs have a waxing and waning course and a follow-up imaging eventually suggests or confirm these pseudo-lesions. On MRI, the THIDS have T1\u2013T2 mismatch and demonstrate a post contrast accentuation without washout. There may be pooling of hepatocyte specific contrast on delayed phases as the normal vessels course through them. Although benign, these lesions merit a closer and careful evaluation if in a cirrhotic background, to avoid missing an HCC. Pseudotumours like arterio-portal (A-P) shunts should be ruled out with the help of angiography or CTHA. During such events, use of Gd-EOB-MRI or Kupffer phase of Sonazoid-enhanced US would be useful as they would determine the presence reduced number of Kupffer cells in hepatobiliary phase. Regenerating nodules less than 3 mm or less in size are termed as micronodules whereas, those more than 3 mm are called macronodules. These nodules may diffusely involve the liver parenchyma making it difficult for detection and identification. The vascular profile of the regenerative nodule is similar to the normal liver parenchyma. These lesions enhance with gadolinium in the portal phase and appear similar to the rest of liver parenchyma. They retain the hepatocyte specific contrast medium due to the preserved hepatic function making it difficult for detection on CT or MR imaging.1Yu N.C. Chaudhari V.

There are certain limitations when siderotic nodules are imaged with GRE (Gradient echo) sequences, but a longer TE (Time to Echo) allows better sensitivity for their detection.1Yu N.C. Chaudhari V.

They have a variable vascular profile, and hence can be confused with regenerative nodule as well as HCC. Dysplastic nodules usually have portovenous blood supply and hence it is difficult to distinguish low-grade dysplastic nodules from regenerative lesions. The high-grade dysplastic nodules have a predominant hepatic arterial supply, and therefore appear similar to HCC.2Luo W. Numata K. Kondo M. et al.Sonazoid-enhanced ultrasonography for evaluation of the enhancement patterns of focal liver tumors in the late phase by intermittent imaging with a high mechanical index.J Ultrasound Med. 2009 Apr; 28: 439-448PubMed Google Scholar Dysplastic nodules lack a capsule, whereas the HCC may have it. Invasion into vascular channels if present indicates presence of HCC rather than dysplastic nodule. With the present day spectrum of imaging modalities, the following enlisted modalities are considered most sensitive to determine the initial pathogenesis of HCC although they are not widely available.(1)Contrast enhanced ultrasound,(2)EOB-MRI,(3)CTAP,(4)CTHA, and(5)MDCT/dynamic MRI, SPIO (Superparamagnetic iron oxide)-MRI. On conventional ultrasound, HCC may present as a solitary mass or there may be surrounding satellite nodules or multifocal. Diffuse tumor infiltration is also sometimes seen. There are several limitations of US in evaluation or detection of HCC, but it is screening test of choice due to its easy availability, safety and cost effectiveness. US has been reported to have a sensitivity of between 65% and 80% and a specificity of greater than 90% when used as a screening test for HCC. A new technique (defect reperfusion imaging) has been described, formulated to facilitate accurate diagnosis of liver cancer, which shows arterial enhancement and venous washout.Tabled 1PhaseTime after injectionArterial phase2\u20133 minKupffer phase6\u201310 min Open table in a new tab Contrast enhanced US is a recent advancement and has two phases: the vascular and Kupffer phases. Sonazoid is intravenously injected. Detection of intranodular blood flow within the HCC is fairly high with contrast enhanced US using sonazoid. Gold standard investigation still remains a four-phase MDCT imaging, which is comparable or superior to other investigations, mainly in cases where detection of arterial flow pattern with the nodule. But when it comes to identification of neoplastic activity in a hypovascular nodule, contrast enhanced ultrasound-Sonazoid gives the maximum information. Per-se, contrast enhanced US may be considered superior to identification of intranodular arterial blood flow. This phase is very stable and hence entire liver scanning is performed in this phase. The principle on which this pharmacokinetics based is that the intravenously injected Sonazoid reaches to the sites of Kupffer defect and defect reperfusion is identified, allowing the cancer detection easy and more definitive. Futuristically, contrast enhanced ultrasound has been projected as investigation for screening and staging of liver tumors.2Luo W. Numata K. Kondo M. et al.Sonazoid-enhanced ultrasonography for evaluation of the enhancement patterns of focal liver tumors in the late phase by intermittent imaging with a high mechanical index.J Ultrasound Med. 2009 Apr; 28: 439-448PubMed Google Scholar A Kupffer defect is evaluated in Kupffer phase 6\u201310 min post arterial enhancement of the lesion. Entire liver needs to be scanned to determine the defect site. A re-injection of contrast is being performed if a Kupffer defect is identified using Sonazoid, without considering the presence or absence of arterial blood flow. The sensitivity to diagnose an HCC approaches 100% after determination of the arterial vascularity within the defect area.2Luo W. Numata K. Kondo M. et al.Sonazoid-enhanced ultrasonography for evaluation of the enhancement patterns of focal liver tumors in the late phase by intermittent imaging with a high mechanical index.J Ultrasound Med. 2009 Apr; 28: 439-448PubMed Google Scholar Concerned nodules cannot be identified on B-mode US, but can be readily diagnosed using defects in Kupffer phase contrast enhanced US, though.8Marrero J.A. Hussain H.K. Nghiem H.V. Umar R. Fontana R.J. Lok A.S. Improving the prediction of hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhotic patients with an arterially-enhancing liver mass.Liver Transpl. 2005 Mar; 11: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar Additional injection of Sonazoid facilitates determination of neovascularization within the Kupffer defect which may eventually help in RFA (radiofrequency thermal ablation).2Luo W. Numata K. Kondo M. et al.Sonazoid-enhanced ultrasonography for evaluation of the enhancement patterns of focal liver tumors in the late phase by intermittent imaging with a high mechanical index.J Ultrasound Med. 2009 Apr; 28: 439-448PubMed Google Scholar This new innovation is now considered as a vital breakthrough in liver cancer imaging. No special device or analysis is required. The induction of such technique allows identification of nodules that show hypervascularity on CT but remain indeterminate on B-mode US with a sensitivity of about 100%. If the nodules are without arterial enhancement, these may differ from nodules detected on CT. This technique of defect reperfusion imaging has a potential to aid in the treatment planning. It can also be applied in as a screening tool in patients with cirrhosis, local tumor status and post treatment follow-up. There is a recent breakthrough in liver cancer imaging with the advent of Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI. EOB-MRI may facilitate the most sensitive and earliest assessment of the early features of HCC. The precancerous lesions show EOB pooling. The signal drop in the hepatobiliary phase within these lesions helps to determine the presence of an early HCC. The molecular and functional status of HCC is becoming a reality of near future. Hepatocyte specific gadolinium chelating agents are relatively new. Gadoxetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA, Primovist, Bayer) and gadopentate dimeglumine (Gd-BOPTA, Multihance, Bracco) are meant to improve diagnosis of HCC and have proven to be similar or better that double contrast MRI or SPIO imaging. The hepatocyte specific contrast agent for MRI, Gd-EOB-DTPA (gadoxetate sodium). This contrast agent pooled in with the hepatocytes and excreted via kidney and from the liver through the bile duct. With 6\u201320 min post injection (hepatobiliary phase), the liver appears diffusely hyperintense. The HCC nodules are devoid of hepatocytes and normal parenchymal cells, hence show hypointensity. As this is a direct feature, the interpretation is easier, in comparison to SPIO agents which depict the liver as a black due to drop in signal deteriorating the spatial resolution.9Roncalli M.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has defined primary end-point radiological pneumonia for use in epidemiological and vaccine studies. However, radiography requires expertise and is often inaccessible. We hypothesized that plasma biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial activation may be useful surrogates for end-point pneumonia, and may provide insight into its biological significance.We studied children with WHO-defined clinical pneumonia (n = 155) within a prospective cohort of 1,005 consecutive febrile children presenting to Tanzanian outpatient clinics. Based on x-ray findings, participants were categorized as primary end-point pneumonia (n = 30), other infiltrates (n = 31), or normal chest x-ray (n = 94). Plasma levels of 7 host response biomarkers at presentation were measured by ELISA. Associations between biomarker levels and radiological findings were assessed by Kruskal-Wallis test and multivariable logistic regression. Biomarker ability to predict radiological findings was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and Classification and Regression Tree analysis.Compared to children with normal x-ray, children with end-point pneumonia had significantly higher C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and Chitinase 3-like-1, while those with other infiltrates had elevated procalcitonin and von Willebrand Factor and decreased soluble Tie-2 and endoglin. Clinical variables were not predictive of radiological findings. Classification and Regression Tree analysis generated multi-marker models with improved performance over single markers for discriminating between groups. A model based on C-reactive protein and Chitinase 3-like-1 discriminated between end-point pneumonia and non-end-point pneumonia with 93.3% sensitivity (95% confidence interval 76.5-98.8), 80.8% specificity (72.6-87.1), positive likelihood ratio 4.9 (3.4-7.1), negative likelihood ratio 0.083 (0.022-0.32), and misclassification rate 0.20 (standard error 0.038).In Tanzanian children with WHO-defined clinical pneumonia, combinations of host biomarkers distinguished between end-point pneumonia, other infiltrates, and normal chest x-ray, whereas clinical variables did not. These findings generate pathophysiological hypotheses and may have potential research and clinical utility."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2109692080", "relevance_score": 190.5987, "publication_year": 1977, "title": "Cardiac connections: The segmental approach to radiologic diagnosis in congenital heart disease", "cited_by_count": 34, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Great arteries", "level": 3, "score": 0.71958804}, {"display_name": "Double outlet right ventricle", "level": 3, "score": 0.70789206}, {"display_name": "Atrioventricular valve", "level": 3, "score": 0.6538186}, {"display_name": "Great vessels", "level": 2, "score": 0.617252}, {"display_name": "Ventricle", "level": 2, "score": 0.598861}, {"display_name": "Cardiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.4898505}, {"display_name": "Heart disease", "level": 2, "score": 0.4130193}, {"display_name": "Anatomy", "level": 1, "score": 0.37315258}, {"display_name": "Internal medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.36079007}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"The": [0, 29, 91, 111, 132, 150, 231], "segmental": [1], "approach": [2], "to": [3, 105, 116, 219, 223, 241], "the": [4, 14, 17, 49, 53, 58, 65, 85, 88, 101, 106, 117, 162, 178, 181, 187, 205, 210, 225, 239, 248, 263], "diagnosis": [5, 173], "and": [6, 24, 35, 38, 55, 64, 73, 153, 160, 169, 189, 207, 213], "classification": [7], "of": [8, 16, 21, 32, 180, 191, 201, 209, 227, 233, 247, 254, 257, 262], "congenital": [9], "heart": [10], "disease,": [11], "which": [12], "emphasizes": [13], "importance": [15], "connections": [18, 40, 76, 134, 179, 208, 249], "(proximal-to-distal": [19], "relationships)": [20], "cardiac": [22, 36, 211], "chambers": [23, 37, 212], "great": [25, 33, 66, 74, 102, 214], "vessels,": [26, 215], "is": [27, 41, 94, 236], "presented.": [28], "radiologic": [30], "identification": [31], "vessels": [34], "their": [39, 61, 69], "described,": [42], "considering,": [43], "in": [44, 119, 203, 245, 252, 259], "turn,": [45], "three": [46, 182], "major": [47, 183], "segments:": [48], "atria": [50, 86, 107, 118], "together": [51], "with": [52, 60, 68, 80], "systemic": [54], "pulmonary": [56], "veins,": [57], "ventricles": [59, 112], "atrioventricular": [62], "valves": [63], "arteries": [67], "outflow": [70], "tracts.": [71], "Cardiac": [72], "vascular": [75], "can": [77, 135], "be": [78, 114, 130, 136, 196], "described": [79], "greatest": [81], "clarity": [82], "by": [83], "using": [84], "as": [87, 96, 138], "starting": [89], "point.": [90], "atrial": [92], "situs": [93], "defined": [95], "solitus,": [97], "inversus": [98], "or": [99, 109, 121, 124, 145, 256], "ambiguus,": [100], "veins": [103], "connecting": [104], "normally": [108], "anomalously.": [110], "may": [113, 129, 195], "connected": [115], "concordant": [120], "discordant": [122], "fashion": [123], "a": [125, 228], "double": [126, 141, 146], "inlet": [127], "ventricle": [128, 144], "present.": [131, 197], "ventriculo-arterial": [133], "classified": [137], "normal,": [139], "transposition,": [140], "outlet": [142, 147], "right": [143], "left": [148], "ventricle.": [149], "angiocardiographic": [151], "techniques": [152], "criteria": [154], "that": [155, 194], "differentiate": [156], "these": [157], "connection": [158, 243], "disorders": [159, 244], "identify": [161], "transitional": [163], "cases": [164], "between": [165], "them": [166], "are": [167, 200], "discussed": [168], "illustrated.": [170], "A": [171], "complete": [172], "must": [174], "indicate": [175], "not": [176], "only": [177], "segments": [184], "but": [185], "also": [186], "malformations": [188, 255], "abnormalities": [190, 258], "spatial": [192, 260], "position": [193, 261], "Certain": [198], "associations": [199], "value": [202], "predicting": [204], "positions": [206], "making": [216], "it": [217], "possible": [218], "formulate": [220], "helpful": [221], "rules": [222, 235], "aid": [224], "progress": [226], "diagnostic": [229], "study.": [230], "fallibility": [232], "such": [234], "discussed,": [237], "emphasizing": [238], "need": [240], "define": [242], "terms": [246, 253], "rather": [250], "than": [251], "individual": [264], "parts.": [265]}, "authors": ["P.

The radiologic identification of great vessels and cardiac chambers and their connections is described, considering, in turn, three major segments: the atria together with the systemic and pulmonary veins, the ventricles with their atrioventricular valves and the great arteries with their outflow tracts. Cardiac and great vascular connections can be described with greatest clarity by using the atria as the starting point. The atrial situs is defined as solitus, inversus or ambiguus, the great veins connecting to the atria normally or anomalously. The ventricles may be connected to the atria in concordant or discordant fashion or a double inlet ventricle may be present. The ventriculo-arterial connections can be classified as normal, transposition, double outlet right ventricle or double outlet left ventricle. The angiocardiographic techniques and criteria that differentiate these connection disorders and identify the transitional cases between them are discussed and illustrated. A complete diagnosis must indicate not only the connections of the three major segments but also the malformations and abnormalities of spatial position that may be present. Certain associations are of value in predicting the positions and connections of the cardiac chambers and great vessels, making it possible to formulate helpful rules to aid the progress of a diagnostic study. The fallibility of such rules is discussed, emphasizing the need to define connection disorders in terms of the connections rather than in terms of malformations or of abnormalities in spatial position of the individual parts."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2971898452", "relevance_score": 184.17683, "publication_year": 2019, "title": "Automated Detection of Radiology Reports that Require Follow-up Imaging Using Natural Language Processing Feature Engineering and Machine Learning Classification", "cited_by_count": 34, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Trigram", "level": 2, "score": 0.83575165}, {"display_name": "Bigram", "level": 3, "score": 0.8254465}, {"display_name": "Artificial intelligence", "level": 1, "score": 0.78985214}, {"display_name": "Machine learning", "level": 1, "score": 0.74445444}, {"display_name": "Naive Bayes classifier", "level": 3, "score": 0.69865197}, {"display_name": "Decision tree", "level": 2, "score": 0.6481045}, {"display_name": "Feature engineering", "level": 3, "score": 0.6370114}, {"display_name": "Feature selection", "level": 2, "score": 0.5510059}, {"display_name": "Principle of maximum entropy", "level": 2, "score": 0.4912557}, {"display_name": "Support vector machine", "level": 2, "score": 0.45795807}, {"display_name": "Feature (linguistics)", "level": 2, "score": 0.43035895}, {"display_name": "Natural language processing", "level": 1, "score": 0.3635326}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"While": [0], "radiologists": [1], "regularly": [2], "issue": [3], "follow-up": [4, 21, 69, 196], "recommendations,": [5], "our": [6], "preliminary": [7], "research": [8], "has": [9], "shown": [10], "that": [11, 66, 205], "anywhere": [12], "from": [13, 94], "35": [14], "to": [15, 46, 59, 102, 174, 199], "50%": [16], "of": [17, 25, 89, 147, 151, 160, 167, 181, 194, 212], "patients": [18], "who": [19], "receive": [20], "recommendations": [22], "for": [23, 34, 42], "findings": [24], "possible": [26], "cancer": [27, 50], "on": [28, 217], "abdominopelvic": [29], "imaging": [30], "do": [31], "not": [32], "return": [33], "follow-up.": [35], "As": [36], "such,": [37], "they": [38], "remain": [39], "at": [40], "risk": [41], "adverse": [43], "outcomes": [44], "related": [45], "missed": [47], "or": [48], "delayed": [49], "diagnosis.": [51], "In": [52], "this": [53, 86, 126], "study,": [54], "we": [55, 129], "develop": [56], "an": [57, 144], "algorithm": [58], "automatically": [60], "detect": [61], "free": [62, 91], "text": [63, 92], "radiology": [64], "reports": [65, 93], "have": [67], "a": [68, 195], "recommendation": [70], "using": [71], "natural": [72], "language": [73], "processing": [74], "(NLP)": [75], "techniques": [76, 99], "and": [77, 113, 122, 135, 149, 162, 187, 209], "machine": [78, 213], "learning": [79, 214], "models.": [80, 138, 169], "The": [81, 139, 170], "data": [82, 127], "set": [83], "used": [84, 101], "in": [85, 115], "study": [87], "consists": [88], "6000": [90], "the": [95, 108, 116, 155, 218], "author\u2019s": [96], "institution.": [97], "NLP": [98], "are": [100], "engineer": [103], "1500": [104], "features,": [105, 177], "which": [106], "include": [107], "most": [109, 192], "informative": [110], "unigrams,": [111], "bigrams,": [112], "trigrams": [114], "training": [117], "corpus": [118], "after": [119], "performing": [120], "tokenization": [121], "Porter": [123], "stemming.": [124], "On": [125], "set,": [128], "train": [130], "naive": [131, 156], "Bayes,": [132], "decision": [133, 140], "tree,": [134], "maximum": [136, 163], "entropy": [137, 164], "tree": [141], "model,": [142], "with": [143, 178, 189], "F1": [145], "score": [146, 159, 166], "0.458": [148], "accuracy": [150], "0.862,": [152], "outperforms": [153], "both": [154], "Bayes": [157], "(F1": [158, 165], "0.381)": [161], "0.387)": [168], "models": [171], "were": [172], "analyzed": [173], "determine": [175], "predictive": [176, 193, 207], "term": [179], "frequency": [180], "n-grams": [182], "such": [183], "as": [184], "\u201crenal": [185], "neoplasm\u201d": [186], "\u201cevalu": [188], "enhanc\u201d": [190], "being": [191], "recommendation.": [197], "Key": [198], "maximizing": [200], "performance": [201], "was": [202], "feature": [203, 219], "engineering": [204], "extracts": [206], "information": [208], "appropriate": [210], "selection": [211], "algorithms": [215], "based": [216], "set.": [220]}, "authors": ["\u0420\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0442 \u041b\u043e\u0443", "Darco Lalevic", "Charles M.

As such, they remain at risk for adverse outcomes related to missed or delayed cancer diagnosis. In this study, we develop an algorithm to automatically detect free text radiology reports that have a follow-up recommendation using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models. The data set used in this study consists of 6000 free text reports from the author\u2019s institution. NLP techniques are used to engineer 1500 features, which include the most informative unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams in the training corpus after performing tokenization and Porter stemming. On this data set, we train naive Bayes, decision tree, and maximum entropy models. The decision tree model, with an F1 score of 0.458 and accuracy of 0.862, outperforms both the naive Bayes (F1 score of 0.381) and maximum entropy (F1 score of 0.387) models.

A total of 36 spatial diversity features were obtained based on pixel abundances within regions of interest. Performance in both the classification tasks was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. For association with 12-month overall survival, area under the ROC curve was 0.74 with confidence intervals [0.630 to 0.858]. The sensitivity and specificity at the optimal operating point (threshold=0.5) on the ROC were 0.59 and 0.75, respectively. For the identification of EGFR-driven tumors, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.85 with confidence intervals [0.750 to 0.945]. The sensitivity and specificity at the optimal operating point (threshold=0.166) on the ROC were 0.76 and 0.83, respectively.

Morphological analysis of lung tissue may help our understanding of pathogenic mechanisms and help to provide consistent personalised management. The aim of this study was to ascertain morphological and immunomolecular features of lung tissue. Transbronchial lung cryobiopsy was carried out in patients with persistent symptoms and computed tomography suggestive of residual lung disease after recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection. 164 patients were referred for suspected pulmonary sequelae after COVID-19; 10 patients with >5% parenchymal lung disease underwent lung biopsy. The histological pattern of lung disease was not homogeneous and three different case clusters could be identified, which was mirrored by their clinical and radiological features. Cluster 1 (\"chronic fibrosing\") was characterised by post-infection progression of pre-existing interstitial pneumonias. Cluster 2 (\"acute/subacute injury\") was characterised by different types and grades of lung injury, ranging from organising pneumonia and fibrosing nonspecific interstitial pneumonia to diffuse alveolar damage. Cluster 3 (\"vascular changes\") was characterised by diffuse vascular increase, dilatation and distortion (capillaries and venules) within otherwise normal parenchyma. Clusters 2 and 3 had immunophenotypical changes similar to those observed in early/mild COVID-19 pneumonias (abnormal expression of STAT3 in hyperplastic pneumocytes and PD-L1, IDO and STAT3 in endothelial cells).

or to permanent handicap. Its characteristic trait is a persistent inflammation of the synovial membrane and the formation of an invasive synovial tissue, called the pannus, which in time leads to destruction of the cartilage, subchondral bone tissue, and the soft tissue of the affected joint(s). The pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis is complex and involves cells of both innate and adaptive immunity, a network of various cytokines and an immunoregulatory dysfunction. An important role in the discovery of rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis was played by magnetic resonance imaging, which showed the disease process to extend beyond the synovium into the bone marrow. Many studies have shown a strict correlation between the vascularity of the synovium (assessed through the power Doppler ultrasound and magnetic resonance examinations), bone marrow edema and the clinical, laboratory and histopathological parameters of rheumatoid arthritis. From the current understanding of rheumatoid arthritis, bone erosions could occur from two directions: from the joint cavity and from the bone marrow. With power Doppler ultrasound, as well as in magnetic resonance imaging, it is possible to visualize the well-vascularized pannus and its destructive effects on joint structures and ligaments. In addition, the magnetic resonance study shows inflammatory and destructive changes within the bone marrow (bone marrow edema, inflammatory cysts, and erosions). Bone marrow edema occurs in 68-75% of patients with early rheumatoid arthritis and is considered to be a predictor of rapid disease progression.

We have created a technique for semi\u2010automated measurement of radiologist reporting time, and through it produced a robust set of absolute time requirements and relative value units for consultant reporting of diagnostic examinations in our hospital. Methods A large sample of reporting times, recorded automatically by the R adiology I nformation S ystem ( COMRAD , S oftware I nnovations, C hristchurch, N ew Z ealand) along with the description of each examination being reported, was placed in a database. Analysis was confined to diagnostic reporting by consultant radiologists. A spreadsheet was produced, listing the total number and the frequency of reporting times of each distinct examination. Outliers with exceptionally long report times (more than 10 min for plain radiography, 30 min for ultrasound, or 60 min for CT or MRI with some exceptions) were culled; this removed 9.5% of the total. Complex CTs requiring separate workstation time were assigned times by consensus. The median time for the remainder of each sample was the assigned absolute reporting time in minutes and seconds. Relative value units were calculated using the reporting time for a single view department chest X\u2010ray of 1 min 38 s including verifying a report made using speech recognition software. Results A schedule of absolute and relative values, based on over 179 000 reports, forms Table 2 of this paper. Conclusions The technique provides a schedule of reporting times with reduced subjective input, which is more robust than existing systems for measuring reporting time."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2027859324", "relevance_score": 310.92926, "publication_year": 2005, "title": "Primary gastrointestinal lymphomas: A radiological-pathological review.

The most frequently used pathology classification of lymphomas is the Revised European and American Lymphoma /World Health Organization classification. The correlation of radiological morphology with histology is relatively poor, although characteristic subtypes will be discussed. In the stomach, the majority of primary lymphomas are of B\u2010cell origin of mucosa\u2010associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type. Low\u2010grade MALT lymphomas are associated with Helicobacter pylori infection and often respond to eradication of this organism. Radiological features include thickened folds, nodularity, depressed lesions, ulcers, prominent areae gastricae. High\u2010grade (large B\u2010cell) tumour patterns include infiltrative, polypoid, nodular, ulcerated or a combination. Endoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound and CT are important in diagnosis and staging, although appearances on barium studies should be recognized. Primary colonic lymphomas are rare. Most are of B\u2010cell origin.

A prospective multicentre study involving non-operative treatment of distal radius fractures in 387 patients aged between 15 and 74 years (398 fractures) was conducted. The presence of cortical comminution and intra-articular involvement according to the Buttazzoni classification is described. Minimally displaced fractures were treated with immobilisation in a cast while displaced fractures underwent closed reduction with subsequent immobilisation. Radiographs were obtained after reduction, at 10 to 14 days and after union. The outcome measure was re-displacement or union. In fractures with volar comminution (Buttazzoni type 4), 96% (53 of 55) displaced. In intra-articular fractures without volar comminution (Buttazzoni 3), 72% (84 of 117) displaced. In extra-articular fractures with isolated dorsal comminution (Buttazzoni 2), 73% (106 of 145) displaced while in non-comminuted fractures (Buttazzoni 1), 16 % (13 of 81 ) displaced. A total of 32% (53 of 165) of initially minimally displaced fractures later displaced. All of the initially displaced volarly comminuted fractures re-displaced. Displacement occurred in 31% (63 of 205) of fractures that were still in good alignment after 10 to 14 days. Regression analysis showed that volar and dorsal comminution predicted later displacement, while intra-articular involvement did not predict displacement. Volar comminution was the strongest predictor of displacement.

Except for the histopathologic finding of noncaseating granulomas in an endomyocardial biopsy specimen, most diagnostic tests are limited and nonspecific at best. Therefore, the decision to initiate treatment is based largely on the patient's clinical symptoms and the course of the disease, rather than histologic confirmation. Successful recognition of cardiac sarcoidosis ultimately requires rigorous collaboration among a clinician, radiologist, and pathologist.

The third employs a set of hand-crafted rules that capture lexical elements (short, meaningful, strings of words) derived from BoosTexter's n-grams, and that are enhanced by shallow semantic information in the form of negation, synonymy, and uncertainty. Our evaluation shows that semantic information significantly contributes to ICD-9-CM coding with lexical elements. Also, a simple hand-crafted rule-based system with lexical elements and semantic information can outperform algorithmically more complex systems, such as Lucene and BoosTexter, when these systems base their ICD-9-CM predictions only upon individual words, n-grams, or s grams."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W1995710993", "relevance_score": 219.11177, "publication_year": 2008, "title": "Radiologic and histologic characterization of silk fibroin as scaffold coating for rabbit tracheal defect repair", "cited_by_count": 33, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Fibroin", "level": 3, "score": 0.99296117}, {"display_name": "Biomaterial", "level": 2, "score": 0.8316365}, {"display_name": "SILK", "level": 2, "score": 0.7713085}, {"display_name": "Coating", "level": 2, "score": 0.61925745}, {"display_name": "Biomedical engineering", "level": 1, "score": 0.505876}, {"display_name": "Granulation tissue", "level": 3, "score": 0.49052876}, {"display_name": "Implant", "level": 2, "score": 0.4452843}, {"display_name": "Anatomy", "level": 1, "score": 0.40175703}, {"display_name": "Wound healing", "level": 2, "score": 0.36103228}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"OBJECTIVES": [0], "To": [1], "explore": [2], "the": [3, 51, 55, 93, 110, 119], "feasibility": [4], "of": [5, 50, 138], "silk": [6, 59, 94, 139], "fibroin": [7, 19, 60, 125, 140], "as": [8, 27], "a": [9, 101, 127], "biomaterial": [10, 130], "coating": [11, 32, 131], "used": [12], "in": [13, 23, 118], "tracheal": [14, 37, 97, 121, 133, 144], "defect": [15, 134], "reconstruction.": [16, 135], "METHODS": [17], "Silk": [18, 124], "was": [20, 45, 62, 74, 85], "subcutaneously": [21], "embedded": [22], "three": [24], "rabbits": [25], "and": [26, 42, 57, 66, 72, 113, 155], "an": [28], "artificial": [29, 111], "implant": [30, 112], "material": [31], "to": [33, 142, 151], "reconstruct": [34], "12": [35], "rabbits'": [36], "defects.": [38], "The": [39, 48, 96, 136], "postoperative": [40], "radiologic": [41], "histologic": [43], "characterization": [44], "summarized.": [46], "RESULTS": [47], "thickness": [49], "fibroblasts": [52], "layer": [53], "covering": [54], "porus": [56], "nonporus": [58], "film": [61], "240.4": [63], "\u00b1": [64, 68], "9.9": [65], "302.3": [67], "10.5": [69], "\u03bcm,": [70], "respectively,": [71], "there": [73], "no": [75, 86, 114], "statistical": [76], "difference": [77], "(P": [78], "<": [79], "0.05)": [80], "within": [81], "each": [82], "group.": [83], "There": [84], "foreign-body": [87], "granuloma": [88], "or": [89], "macrophagocyte": [90], "infiltration": [91], "around": [92], "film.": [95], "reconstruction": [98], "study": [99], "showed": [100], "normal": [102, 106], "mucous": [103, 145], "membrane": [104], "with": [105], "cilial": [107], "growth": [108], "on": [109], "visible": [115], "granulation": [116], "tissue": [117], "reconstructed": [120], "cavity.": [122], "CONCLUSIONS": [123], "is": [126], "potential": [128], "new": [129], "for": [132], "mechanism": [137], "appears": [141], "promote": [143], "membrane,": [146], "which": [147], "may": [148], "be": [149], "related": [150], "its": [152], "molecular": [153], "structure": [154], "biology.": [156]}, "authors": ["Yusu Ni", "Xia Zhao", "Liang Zhou", "Zhengzhong Shao", "Weili Yan", "Xin Chen", "Zhijian Cao", "Xue Zhang", "Jack J.

METHODS Silk fibroin was subcutaneously embedded in three rabbits and as an artificial implant material coating to reconstruct 12 rabbits' tracheal defects. The postoperative radiologic and histologic characterization was summarized. RESULTS The thickness of the fibroblasts layer covering the porus and nonporus silk fibroin film was 240.4 \u00b1 9.9 and 302.3 \u00b1 10.5 \u03bcm, respectively, and there was no statistical difference (P < 0.05) within each group. There was no foreign-body granuloma or macrophagocyte infiltration around the silk film. The tracheal reconstruction study showed a normal mucous membrane with normal cilial growth on the artificial implant and no visible granulation tissue in the reconstructed tracheal cavity. CONCLUSIONS Silk fibroin is a potential new biomaterial coating for tracheal defect reconstruction. The mechanism of silk fibroin appears to promote tracheal mucous membrane, which may be related to its molecular structure and biology."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W4232148803", "relevance_score": 214.91748, "publication_year": 1998, "title": "Pertinence Generation in Radiological Diagnosis: Spreading Activation and the Nature of Expertise", "cited_by_count": 33, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Reinterpretation", "level": 2, "score": 0.8411553}, {"display_name": "Medical diagnosis", "level": 2, "score": 0.5578389}, {"display_name": "Process (computing)", "level": 2, "score": 0.5013838}, {"display_name": "Cognition", "level": 2, "score": 0.48665172}, {"display_name": "Phenomenon", "level": 2, "score": 0.48642516}, {"display_name": "Artificial intelligence", "level": 1, "score": 0.45977864}, {"display_name": "Cognitive psychology", "level": 1, "score": 0.42193675}, {"display_name": "Cognitive science", "level": 1, "score": 0.41740274}, {"display_name": "Natural language processing", "level": 1, "score": 0.3980321}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"An": [0], "empirical": [1], "study": [2], "of": [3, 17, 47, 108, 118, 121, 137, 147], "human": [4, 20], "expert": [5], "reasoning": [6, 87], "processes": [7], "is": [8, 12, 36, 42, 126], "presented.": [9], "Its": [10], "purpose": [11], "to": [13, 25, 57, 92, 96], "test": [14], "a": [15, 19], "model": [16, 41, 68], "how": [18], "expert's": [21], "cognitive": [22], "system": [23], "learns": [24], "detect,": [26, 29], "and": [27, 32, 74, 95, 111, 149], "does": [28], "pertinent": [30], "data": [31], "hypotheses.": [33], "This": [34], "process": [35], "called": [37], "pertinence": [38, 70], "generation.": [39], "The": [40, 100], "based": [43], "on": [44, 152], "the": [45, 67, 80, 119, 145, 153], "phenomenon": [46], "spreading": [48], "activation": [49], "within": [50], "semantic": [51, 76], "networks.": [52], "Twenty-two": [53], "radiologists": [54], "were": [55, 88], "asked": [56], "produce": [58], "diagnoses": [59], "from": [60, 144], "two": [61, 104], "very": [62], "difficult": [63], "X-ray": [64], "films.": [65], "As": [66], "predicted,": [69], "increased": [71], "with": [72, 75], "experience": [73], "network": [77], "integration.": [78], "However,": [79], "experts": [81], "whose": [82], "daily": [83], "work": [84], "involved": [85], "explicit": [86], "able,": [89], "in": [90, 132], "addition,": [91], "go": [93], "beyond": [94], "generate": [97], "more": [98], "pertinence.": [99], "results": [101, 120], "suggest": [102], "that": [103, 129], "qualitatively": [105], "different": [106], "kinds": [107], "expertise,": [109], "basic": [110, 148], "super,": [112], "should": [113], "be": [114], "distinguished.": [115], "A": [116], "reinterpretation": [117], "Lesgold": [122], "et": [123], "al.": [124], "(1988)": [125], "proposed,": [127], "suggesting": [128], "apparent": [130], "nonmonotonicities": [131], "performance": [133], "are": [134], "not": [135], "representative": [136], "common": [138], "radiological": [139], "expertise": [140, 151], "acquisition": [141], "but": [142], "result": [143], "inclusion": [146], "super": [150], "same": [154], "curve.": [155]}, "authors": ["\u00c9ric Raufaste", "H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Eyrolle", "Claudette Marin\u00e9"], "abstract": "An empirical study of human expert reasoning processes is presented. Its purpose is to test a model of how a human expert's cognitive system learns to detect, and does detect, pertinent data and hypotheses. This process is called pertinence generation. The model is based on the phenomenon of spreading activation within semantic networks. Twenty-two radiologists were asked to produce diagnoses from two very difficult X-ray films. As the model predicted, pertinence increased with experience and with semantic network integration. However, the experts whose daily work involved explicit reasoning were able, in addition, to go beyond and to generate more pertinence. The results suggest that two qualitatively different kinds of expertise, basic and super, should be distinguished. A reinterpretation of the results of Lesgold et al.

This is particularly important given the increasing incidence of antibiotic resistance, complications from nosocomial infection, cost of health care, and emphasis on quality of care. This document summarizes the findings from the available surgical and IR literature on this topic. There is, however, a general lack of published randomized controlled studies on this subject. This guideline represents a joint effort with our nursing colleagues from the Association of periOperative Room Nurses (AORN) and the Association for Radiologic and Imaging Nursing. Segments consist of consensus experience of practitioners with expertise in performing IR procedures. Given the limited scientific foundation, most of the recommendations presented in this document are intended to guide clinical practice rather than mandate the use of specific algorithms. Clean and sterile procedures are clarified, and interventional procedures are classified between the two subtypes for recommendation purposes. The membership of the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) Standards of Practice Committee represents experts in a broad spectrum of interventional procedures from both the private and academic sectors of medicine. Generally, Standards of Practice committee members dedicate the vast majority of their professional time to performing interventional procedures; as such they represent a valid broad expert constituency of the subject matter under consideration for standards production. Technical documents specifying the exact consensus and literature review methodologies as well as the institutional affiliations and professional credentials of the authors of this document are available on request from SIR, 3975 Fair Ridge Dr, Ste 400 North, Fairfax, VA 22033. SIR produces its Standards of Practice documents using the following process. Standards documents of relevance and timeliness are conceptualized by the Standards of Practice committee members. A recognized expert is identified to serve as the principal author for the standard. Additional authors may be assigned depending on the magnitude of the project. An in-depth literature search is performed using electronic medical literature databases. A critical review of peer-reviewed articles is then performed with regard to the study methodology, results, and conclusions. The qualitative weight of these articles is assembled into an evidence table, which is used to write the document so that it contains evidence-based data with respect to content, rates, and thresholds. When the evidence of the literature is weak, conflicting, or contradictory, consensus for the parameter is reached by a minimum of 12 Standards of Practice committee members using a modified Delphi consensus method (1Sacks D.

Chassin M. Brook R.H. Consensus methods: characteristics and guidelines for use.Am J Public Health. 1984; 74: 979-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar). For purposes of these documents, consensus is defined as an 80% Delphi participant agreement on a value or parameter. The draft document is critically reviewed by the Standards of Practice Committee members, either by a telephone conference call or a face-to-face meeting. The finalized draft from the committee is sent to the SIR membership for further input/criticism during a 30-day comment period. These comments are discussed by the Standards of Practice Committee, and appropriate revisions are made to create the finished standards document. Before its publication, the document is endorsed by the SIR Executive Council. The current guidelines were written to help determine appropriate sterile technique and infection control for vascular radiology and IR procedures. The elements of care necessitate knowledge of the following: (a) the category, sterile or clean, into which the anticipated procedure falls; (b) evaluation before the procedure and patient-specific factors that may be associated with a higher likelihood of infection around the procedure; and (c) follow-up after the procedure. The outcome measures or indicators for this process are the indications and complication rates, namely, SSIs. The SIR is committed to the basic principles of outcome-focused, evidence-based medicine. Ideally, every Standards of Practice Committee recommendation would be based on evidence derived from multiple prospective randomized trials of adequate statistical power. Unfortunately, there currently exist no published multicenter randomized trials that evaluate the clinical efficacy and indications for sterile technique during IR procedures. The SIR recognizes the potential pitfalls of developing evidence-based standards for infection control and sterile technique and of making recommendations regarding the use of infection control techniques based on studies of suboptimal design. The current document was drafted by the SIR Standards of Practice Committee and therefore includes the consensus experience of interventional radiologists and nursing professionals with expertise in performing IR procedures.

Experience with Trabecular Titanium\u2122 (TT) cups (Limacorporate S.p.a.) has not been widely reported. Therefore, we assessed the survivorship and clinical and radiological outcomes of patients receiving TT cups, with or without supplementary trabecular titanium hemispherical modules for acetabular reconstruction, in primary and revision total hip arthroplasty (THA). Methods Between January 2009 and July 2014, we performed 67 revisions and 5 primary THAs using TT cups in 69 patients. To achieve stability and/or restore the hip's centre of rotation, hemispherical modules were used in 17 cases based on pre-operative templating and/or intraoperative findings. Mean follow-up was 30.5 months. Acetabular bone defects were classified according to the Paprosky classification. Survivorship, functional outcomes (Merle d'Aubign\u00e9) and radiological outcomes were analysed. Results 8 patients underwent cup revision: 2 for loosening, 3 for infection, and 3 for hip dislocation. The remaining cases did not present radiological signs of loosening. None of the cases with Paprosky type I classifications needed revision, while 4 with type II and 4 with type III needed revision (p = 0.028). The respective mean values for pain, walking, and range of motion (Merle d'Aubign\u00e9 scores \u00b1 standard deviation) were 3.6 \u00b1 1.4, 3.7 \u00b1 0.7, and 3.8 \u00b1 0.6 pre-operatively, and 5.7 \u00b1 0.7, 5.3 \u00b1 0.7, and 5.6 \u00b1 0.7 at the latest follow-up (p&lt;0.001).

The present work seeks to demonstrate that automated image analyses for American College of Radiology (ACR) mammographic accreditation phantom (MAP) images may be performed by a computer with objectivity, once a human acceptance level has been established. Twelve MAP images were generated with different x-ray techniques and digitized. Nineteen medical physicists in diagnostic roles (five of which were specially trained in mammography) viewed the original film images under similar conditions and provided individual scores for each test object (fibrils, microcalcifications, and nodules). Fourier domain template matching, used for low-level processing, combined with derivative filters, for intermediate-level processing, provided translation and rotation-independent localization of the test objects in the MAP images. The visibility classification decision was modeled by a Bayesian classifer using threshold contrast. The 50% visibility contrast threshold established by the trained observers' responses were: fibrils 1.010, microcalcifications 1.156, and nodules 1.016. Using these values as an estimate of human observer performance and given the automated localization of test objects, six images were graded with the computer algorithm. In all but one instance, the algorithm scored the images the same as the diagnostic physicists. In the case where it did not, the margin of disagreement was 10% due to the fact that the human scoring did not allow for half-visible fibrils (agreement occurred for the other test objects). The implication from this is that an operator-independent, machine-based scoring of MAP images is feasible and could be used as a tool to help eliminate the effect of observer variability within the current system, given proper, consistent digitization is performed."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2416938815", "relevance_score": 204.61542, "publication_year": 2003, "title": "Radiologic outcome and its relationship to functional disability in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.", "cited_by_count": 33, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Radiography", "level": 2, "score": 0.61055684}, {"display_name": "Rheumatology", "level": 2, "score": 0.5786161}, {"display_name": "Rheumatoid arthritis", "level": 2, "score": 0.5720465}, {"display_name": "Rheumatoid factor", "level": 3, "score": 0.54222065}, {"display_name": "Internal medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.53968906}, {"display_name": "Arthritis", "level": 2, "score": 0.5184495}, {"display_name": "Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis", "level": 3, "score": 0.49322337}, {"display_name": "Severity of illness", "level": 2, "score": 0.42541313}, {"display_name": "Physical therapy", "level": 1, "score": 0.36347634}, {"display_name": "Surgery", "level": 1, "score": 0.3358776}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"To": [0], "determine": [1], "the": [2, 11, 63, 71, 89, 115, 209, 258, 288], "radiologic": [3], "outcome": [4], "in": [5, 145, 157, 172, 211, 257, 293], "juvenile": [6], "rheumatoid": [7, 133], "arthritis": [8, 40], "(JRA)": [9], "and": [10, 62, 77, 88, 106, 125, 138, 149, 168, 185, 189, 223, 253, 260, 271], "relationship": [12], "of": [13, 28, 35, 39, 65, 117, 177, 204, 208, 233, 238, 262], "radiologically": [14], "detected": [15], "joint": [16, 118, 165, 178, 217, 247, 255, 263, 278], "damage": [17, 179, 264], "to": [18, 47, 102, 291], "functional": [19, 283], "disability": [20], "using": [21], "multivariate": [22], "analyses.Selection": [23], "criteria": [24], "included": [25], "a": [26, 56, 97, 226, 239], "diagnosis": [27], "JRA": [29, 268], "made": [30], "by": [31, 70, 96, 216, 221, 225, 246], "1977": [32], "American": [33], "College": [34], "Rheumatology": [36], "criteria,": [37], "onset": [38, 86, 269], ">": [41, 51, 242], "or": [42, 52], "=": [43, 53], "5": [44], "years": [45, 84], "prior": [46], "study,": [48, 206], "current": [49], "age": [50], "8": [54], "years,": [55], "minimum": [57], "grade": [58], "3": [59], "reading": [60], "ability,": [61], "availability": [64], "radiographs.": [66], "Disability": [67], "was": [68, 214], "measured": [69], "Childhood": [72], "Health": [73], "Assessment": [74], "Questionnaire": [75], "(CHAQ)": [76], "Steinbrocker": [78, 240], "classifications.": [79], "Radiographs": [80], "taken": [81], "within": [82, 201], "2": [83], "after": [85], "(early)": [87], "most": [90, 155, 181], "recent": [91], "radiographs": [92, 114, 199], "(late)": [93], "were": [94, 111, 121, 154, 180, 191, 244], "examined": [95], "single": [98], "pediatric": [99], "radiologist": [100], "blinded": [101], "patients'": [103], "identities,": [104], "diagnoses,": [105], "outcomes.": [107], "Multiple": [108], "regression": [109], "analyses": [110], "performed.On": [112], "late": [113], "frequencies": [116, 259], "space": [119, 166, 218, 248, 279], "narrowing": [120, 167], "38,": [122], "14,": [123], "43,": [124], "79%,": [126], "respectively,": [127], "among": [128, 267, 272], "patients": [129, 158, 196], "with": [130, 159, 282], "systemic,": [131], "pauciarticular,": [132], "factor": [134], "(RF)": [135], "negative": [136], "polyarticular,": [137], "RF": [139], "positive": [140], "polyarticular": [141, 161], "onset;": [142], "erosions": [143, 153, 169], "occurred": [144, 170], "63,": [146], "25,": [147], "39,": [148], "75%,": [150], "respectively.": [151], "Early": [152], "frequent": [156, 182], "RF+": [160], "onset,": [162, 252], "while": [163, 187], "both": [164, 266], "early": [171], "systemic": [173, 251], "onset.": [174], "Radiologic": [175], "signs": [176], "at": [183], "hips": [184], "wrists,": [186], "knees": [188], "ankles": [190], "relatively": [192], "spared.": [193], "Based": [194], "on": [195, 229], "who": [197], "had": [198], "performed": [200], "one": [202], "year": [203], "clinical": [205], "17.7%": [207], "variation": [210, 292], "CHAQ": [212, 294], "score": [213], "explained": [215], "narrowing,": [219, 249, 280], "32.4%": [220], "pain,": [222, 250], "5%": [224], "severe": [227], "rating": [228], "physician's": [230], "global": [231], "estimate": [232], "disease": [234], "activity.": [235], "The": [236], "odds": [237], "class": [241], "I": [243], "increased": [245], "active": [254], "count.Differences": [256], "patterns": [261], "occur": [265], "subtypes": [270], "individual": [273], "joints.": [274], "Radiographic": [275], "damage,": [276], "especially": [277], "correlates": [281], "disability.": [284], "However,": [285], "pain": [286], "is": [287], "major": [289], "contributor": [290], "scores.": [295]}, "authors": ["Kiem Oen", "Martin H.

Disability was measured by the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ) and Steinbrocker classifications. Radiographs taken within 2 years after onset (early) and the most recent radiographs (late) were examined by a single pediatric radiologist blinded to patients' identities, diagnoses, and outcomes. Multiple regression analyses were performed.On late radiographs the frequencies of joint space narrowing were 38, 14, 43, and 79%, respectively, among patients with systemic, pauciarticular, rheumatoid factor (RF) negative polyarticular, and RF positive polyarticular onset; erosions occurred in 63, 25, 39, and 75%, respectively. Early erosions were most frequent in patients with RF+ polyarticular onset, while both joint space narrowing and erosions occurred early in systemic onset. Radiologic signs of joint damage were most frequent at hips and wrists, while knees and ankles were relatively spared. Based on patients who had radiographs performed within one year of clinical study, 17.7% of the variation in CHAQ score was explained by joint space narrowing, 32.4% by pain, and 5% by a severe rating on physician's global estimate of disease activity. The odds of a Steinbrocker class > I were increased by joint space narrowing, pain, systemic onset, and active joint count.Differences in the frequencies and patterns of joint damage occur both among JRA onset subtypes and among individual joints.

The importance of a reliable technique is further illustrated by lesions occupying the ventricle behind the interventricular foramina (Monro). Intraventricular tumours may spring from the ependymal lining (ependymomas), from the neuroglia close to the ventricles (various kinds of gliomas), or from the structures that lie within the ventricular cavities such as the choroid plexus (papillomas), the paraphysis (colloid cysts), or the tela choroidea (meningiomas). Other tumours may originate in structures close by, tumours that come to invaginate themselves into the interior of the ventricles though springing from tissues strictly external. The chief of these are the pinealomas, the gliomas of the quadrigeminal region and of the basal ganglia, and those of congenital pituitary origin (the Rathke pouch or pituitary duct anlage tumours that have already been illustrated). It will be seen that these groups allow of classification into primary intraventricular and primary extraventricular tumours, and one can debate as to whether some tumours, such as the pinealomas, should be included in the one group or the other. Although intellectually interesting, a problem of this kind is not a vital one to the radiologist, but he must study these questions.

"consistent": [446], "hydromyelia.": [448]}, "authors": ["E R Heinz", "Edward B. Schlesinger", "D. Gordon Potts"], "abstract": "Hydromyelia is a condition in which the central canal of the spinal cord is pathologically dilated, usually from the fourth ventricle to the lower end of the spinal cord. Although some authors have described syringomyelia and hydromyelia as being the same entity, with cases assigned to one category or another, according to whether or not the typical symptoms of syringomyelia were present during life, there is some justification for separating them pathologically and etiologically. The authors present 4 cases with observations which give a better understanding of this entity (3). Mechanical Theory of Hydromyelia Immediately after its closure, the neural tube of the normal embryo becomes distended because fluid forms within it more rapidly than it can escape through the semipermeable rhombic roof. Since this distention affects the central canal of the cord as well as the cerebral ventricles, it follows that both hydrocephalus and hydromyelia are physiologic in embryonal life. The term, hydrocephalomyelia, therefore describes this normal state. If adequate perforation of the rhombic roof does not occur during the critical six- to eight-week embryo period, fluid will not filter through it in sufficient quantity to dissect open the developing subarachnoid spaces. The central canal, which normally closes, would thus be maintained as a function of the increased ventricular fluid pressure, which in turn would cause distention of the spinal central canal. Case Reports Case I: M. W., a 55-year-old white woman, was first admitted to the Neurological Institute in 1960 with a history of eight years progressive spasticity of the legs and eighteen days urinary retention. One episode of fecal incontinence had also occurred. At the time of admission the patient was unable to stand. Neurological examination revealed a left Horner's syndrome with spastic quadriparesis and hyperreflexia, more marked on the right side. A probable sensory level was noted at C4. Plain films of the foramen magnum region disclosed partial assimilation of the first cervical vertebra into the occiput and moderate platybasia. There was no evidence of enlargement of the cervical spinal cord. A posterior fossa craniectomy and C1-C2 laminectomy showed that the foramen magnum was relatively tight. There was an Arnold-Chiari malformation, with the tonsils a moderate distance below the foramen magnum. The foramen magnum and upper cervical region were decompressed (Fig. 1). Postoperatively, the patient improved in strength to the point where she was able to walk and a catheter was not required. The patient was readmitted in June 1964, with a five-month history of increasing difficulty in walking, frequent urinary incontinence, and occasional fecal incontinence. Another myelogram at this time showed that the spinal cord was tethered to the dura posteriorly at C1, with definite enlargement of the cervical spinal cord consistent with hydromyelia."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2134669342", "relevance_score": 199.53331, "publication_year": 2013, "title": "Now You See It, Now You Don\u2019t: Visual Illusions in Radiology", "cited_by_count": 33, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Illusion", "level": 2, "score": 0.8940351}, {"display_name": "Optical illusion", "level": 3, "score": 0.7462663}, {"display_name": "Stimulus modality", "level": 3, "score": 0.6308648}, {"display_name": "Perception", "level": 2, "score": 0.58140916}, {"display_name": "Cognitive psychology", "level": 1, "score": 0.4780817}, {"display_name": "Visual perception", "level": 3, "score": 0.46839166}, {"display_name": "Sensory system", "level": 2, "score": 0.45658368}, {"display_name": "Mental image", "level": 3, "score": 0.42909527}, {"display_name": "Neuroscience", "level": 1, "score": 0.24831325}, {"display_name": "Cognition", "level": 2, "score": 0.21986264}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Visual": [0, 54], "illusions": [1, 28, 55, 146, 184, 196], "are": [2, 29, 82, 113, 142], "distortions,": [3], "alterations,": [4], "or": [5], "alternatives": [6], "in": [7, 32, 56, 65, 108, 185], "the": [8, 16, 23, 45, 63, 66, 89, 125, 134, 139, 192], "appearance": [9], "of": [10, 22, 47, 74, 99, 128, 163, 182, 194], "reality": [11], "that": [12, 86, 112], "result": [13, 137], "primarily": [14], "from": [15, 138], "sensory": [17, 117], "and": [18, 34, 79, 91, 105, 170, 173], "perceptual": [19], "processing": [20], "mechanisms": [21], "human": [24], "visual": [25, 67, 84, 145, 164, 183], "system.": [26], "These": [27], "common": [30], "phenomena": [31, 85], "radiology,": [33], "it": [35], "is": [36], "important": [37], "to": [38, 50, 62, 154, 177], "understand": [39], "them": [40], "because": [41], "they": [42, 71], "can": [43, 58], "create": [44], "illusion": [46], "disease,": [48], "leading": [49], "incorrect": [51], "image": [52, 122, 129], "interpretation.": [53], "radiology": [57, 186], "be": [59, 155], "organized": [60], "according": [61], "point": [64], "system": [68], "at": [69], "which": [70], "emerge.": [72], "Illusions": [73, 98, 127], "sensation,": [75], "including": [76], "Mach": [77], "bands": [78], "background": [80], "effect,": [81], "\u201clower-order\u201d": [83], "occur": [87, 107, 147], "as": [88, 102, 133], "eye": [90], "brain": [92, 110], "translate": [93], "light": [94], "into": [95, 119], "neural": [96], "activity.": [97], "perception,": [100], "such": [101], "ambiguous": [103], "figures": [104], "distortion,": [106], "\u201chigher-order\u201d": [109], "structures": [111], "responsible": [114], "for": [115, 197], "coalescing": [116], "input": [118], "a": [120, 161], "mental": [121], "interpreted": [123], "by": [124, 190], "mind.": [126], "formation": [130], "(eg,": [131], "parallax),": [132], "name": [135], "implies,": [136], "way": [140], "images": [141], "generated.": [143], "Some": [144], "with": [148], "all": [149], "modalities,": [150], "whereas": [151], "others": [152], "tend": [153], "modality": [156], "specific.": [157], "The": [158], "authors": [159], "discuss": [160], "variety": [162], "illusions,": [165], "describing": [166], "their": [167, 175], "underlying": [168], "psychologic": [169], "neuroscientific": [171], "basis": [172], "demonstrating": [174], "relevance": [176], "radiology.": [178], "A": [179], "thorough": [180], "understanding": [181], "enhances": [187], "diagnostic": [188], "accuracy": [189], "minimizing": [191], "risk": [193], "mistaking": [195], "disease.": [198]}, "authors": ["Christopher E.

These illusions are common phenomena in radiology, and it is important to understand them because they can create the illusion of disease, leading to incorrect image interpretation. Visual illusions in radiology can be organized according to the point in the visual system at which they emerge. Illusions of sensation, including Mach bands and background effect, are \u201clower-order\u201d visual phenomena that occur as the eye and brain translate light into neural activity. Illusions of perception, such as ambiguous figures and distortion, occur in \u201chigher-order\u201d brain structures that are responsible for coalescing sensory input into a mental image interpreted by the mind. Illusions of image formation (eg, parallax), as the name implies, result from the way images are generated. Some visual illusions occur with all modalities, whereas others tend to be modality specific. The authors discuss a variety of visual illusions, describing their underlying psychologic and neuroscientific basis and demonstrating their relevance to radiology. A thorough understanding of visual illusions in radiology enhances diagnostic accuracy by minimizing the risk of mistaking illusions for disease."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2133442313", "relevance_score": 198.3033, "publication_year": 2013, "title": "Endovascular Treatment of 300 Consecutive Middle Cerebral Artery Aneurysms: Clinical and Radiologic Outcomes", "cited_by_count": 33, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Aneurysm", "level": 2, "score": 0.785602}, {"display_name": "Glasgow Outcome Scale", "level": 3, "score": 0.73949337}, {"display_name": "Surgery", "level": 1, "score": 0.62454265}, {"display_name": "Middle cerebral artery", "level": 3, "score": 0.56787694}, {"display_name": "Occlusion", "level": 2, "score": 0.5033056}, {"display_name": "Retrospective cohort study", "level": 2, "score": 0.4825851}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.44875795}, {"display_name": "Endovascular treatment", "level": 3, "score": 0.44684875}, {"display_name": "Glasgow Coma Scale", "level": 2, "score": 0.33951813}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"There": [0], "is": [1, 222], "controversy": [2], "as": [3, 224], "to": [4], "the": [5, 14, 74, 83, 157, 225], "best": [6], "mode": [7], "of": [8, 16, 21, 32, 55, 93, 174, 193, 204, 215, 228], "treating": [9], "MCA": [10, 42, 98, 205, 229], "aneurysms.": [11, 230], "We": [12], "report": [13], "results": [15], "a": [17, 29, 33, 163], "large": [18], "endovascular": [19, 202], "series": [20], "patients": [22, 39, 95, 130, 135, 142, 154, 176, 195], "treated": [23, 44, 101], "at": [24, 86], "our": [25], "center.This": [26], "study": [27], "was": [28, 111, 120, 185], "retrospective": [30], "analysis": [31], "prospectively": [34], "acquired": [35], "data": [36], "base.": [37], "All": [38], "with": [40, 69, 73, 82, 96, 212], "saccular": [41], "aneurysms": [43, 99, 105, 189, 206], "between": [45], "November": [46], "1996": [47], "and": [48, 62, 78, 89, 137, 148, 218], "June": [49], "2012": [50], "were": [51, 66, 100, 150, 197], "included.": [52], "World": [53], "Federation": [54], "Neurosurgical": [56], "Societies": [57], "grade,": [58], "aneurysm": [59, 63, 183], "site,": [60], "size,": [61], "neck": [64, 118], "size": [65], "recorded,": [67], "along": [68], "clinical": [70, 165], "outcome": [71, 166], "assessed": [72, 81], "Glasgow": [75], "Outcome": [76, 168], "Scale": [77, 169], "radiographic": [79], "occlusion": [80, 116], "Raymond": [84], "classification": [85], "6": [87], "months": [88], "2.5": [90], "years.A": [91], "total": [92, 173, 192], "295": [94], "300": [97], "including": [102], "244": [103], "ruptured": [104, 158], "(80.7%).": [106], "The": [107], "technical": [108, 216], "failure": [109, 217], "rate": [110], "4.3%": [112], "(13": [113], "patients).": [114], "Complete": [115], "or": [117], "remnant": [119, 184], "achieved": [121], "in": [122, 128, 133, 140, 152, 187], "264": [123], "(91.4%).": [124], "Complications": [125], "included": [126], "rupture": [127], "15": [129], "(5%),": [131], "thromboembolism": [132], "17": [134], "(5.7%),": [136], "early": [138], "rebleeding": [139], "3": [141], "(1%).": [143], "Overall": [144], "permanent": [145], "procedural-related": [146], "morbidity": [147], "mortality": [149], "seen": [151, 186], "12": [153], "(7.8%).": [155], "Of": [156], "aneurysms,": [159], "189": [160], "(79.4%)": [161], "had": [162], "favorable": [164], "(Glasgow": [167], "score,": [170], "4-5).": [171], "A": [172, 191], "33": [175], "(13.6%)": [177], "died.": [178], "On": [179], "initial": [180], "angiographic": [181], "follow-up,": [182], "18": [188], "(8.1%).": [190], "13": [194], "(4.3%)": [196], "re-treated.Our": [198], "experience": [199], "demonstrates": [200], "that": [201], "treatment": [203, 227], "has": [207], "an": [208], "acceptable": [209, 223], "safety": [210], "profile": [211], "low": [213], "rates": [214], "re-treatment.": [219], "Therefore,": [220], "coiling": [221], "primary": [226]}, "authors": ["Alex Mortimer", "Marcus Bradley", "Peter Mews", "Andrew Molyneux", "Shelley Renowden"], "abstract": "There is controversy as to the best mode of treating MCA aneurysms.

The patient images were labeled with prostate biopsy including Gleason Score (6 to 10) or Grade Group (1 to 5) and reviewed by one pathologist (with 15 years of experience). Deep learning models were developed to distinguish 1) benign from cancerous tumor and 2) high-risk tumor from low-risk tumor.To evaluate our models, we calculated negative predictive value, positive predictive value, specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy. We also calculated areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUCs) and Cohen's kappa.Our computational method (https://github.com/ih-lab/AI-biopsy) achieved AUCs of 0.89 (95% confidence interval [CI]: [0.86-0.92]) and 0.78 (95% CI: [0.74-0.82]) to classify cancer vs. benign and high- vs. low-risk of prostate disease, respectively.AI-biopsy provided a data-driven and reproducible way to assess cancer risk from MR images and a personalized strategy to potentially reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies. AI-biopsy highlighted the regions of MR images that contained the predictive features the algorithm used for diagnosis using the class activation map method. It is a fully automatic method with a drag-and-drop web interface (https://ai-biopsy.eipm-research.org) that allows radiologists to review AI-assessed MR images in real time.1 TECHNICAL EFFICACY

Severe cases such as, hyperinfection syndrome (HS) and disseminated strongyloidiasis (DS), can involve pulmonary manifestations. These manifestations frequently aid the diagnosis of strongyloidiasis. Here, we present the pulmonary manifestations and radiological findings of severe strongyloidiasis.From January 2004 to December 2014, all patients diagnosed with severe strongyloidiasis at the University of the Ryukyus Hospital or affiliated hospitals in Okinawa, Japan, were included in this retrospective study. All diagnoses were confirmed by the microscopic or histopathological identification of larvae. Severe strongyloidiasis was defined by the presence of any of the following: 1) the identification of S. stercoralis from extra gastrointestinal specimens, 2) sepsis, 3) meningitis, 4) acute respiratory failure, or 5) respiratory tract hemorrhage. Patients were assigned to either HS or DS. Medical records were further reviewed to extract related clinical features and radiological findings.Sixteen severe strongyloidiasis cases were included. Of those, fifteen cases had pulmonary manifestations, eight had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (53%), seven had enteric bacterial pneumonia (46%) and five had pulmonary hemorrhage (33%). Acute respiratory failure was a common indicator for pulmonary manifestation (87%). Chest X-ray findings frequently showed diffuse shadows (71%). Additionally, ileum gas was detected for ten of the sixteen cases in the upper abdomen during assessment with chest X-ray. While, chest CT findings frequently showed ground-glass opacity (GGO) in 89% of patients. Interlobular septal thickening was also frequently shown (67%), always accompanying GGO in upper lobes.In summary, our study described HS/DS cases with pulmonary manifestations including, ARDS, bacterial pneumonia and pulmonary hemorrhage. Chest X-ray findings in HS/DS cases frequently showed diffuse shadows, and the combination of GGO and interlobular septal thickening in chest CT was common in HS/DS, regardless of accompanying pulmonary manifestations. This CT finding suggests alveolar hemorrhage could be used as a potential marker indicating the transition from latent to symptomatic state. Respiratory specimens are especially useful for detecting larvae in cases of HS/DS."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2096830367", "relevance_score": 184.13187, "publication_year": 2014, "title": "Correlation between radiological assessment and histopathological diagnosis in retroperitoneal tumors: Analysis of 291 consecutive patients at a tertiary reference sarcoma center", "cited_by_count": 33, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Sarcoma", "level": 2, "score": 0.70576954}, {"display_name": "Histopathology", "level": 2, "score": 0.67101216}, {"display_name": "Liposarcoma", "level": 3, "score": 0.65103316}, {"display_name": "Radiological weapon", "level": 2, "score": 0.5411264}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.5332548}, {"display_name": "Nuclear medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.35709405}, {"display_name": "Pathology", "level": 1, "score": 0.33206922}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Aim": [0], "of": [1, 41, 49, 102, 120, 137, 157, 171, 180, 184], "study": [2], "was": [3, 71, 105, 144, 148], "to": [4, 27, 46, 63, 162], "assess": [5], "the": [6, 47, 168, 185], "correlation": [7], "between": [8], "computed": [9], "tomography": [10], "scan": [11], "(CT)": [12], "findings": [13], "and": [14, 65, 95, 111, 118, 127, 130, 134, 146, 151, 155, 175], "histopathology.Data": [15], "were": [16, 43, 83, 90, 125, 132, 153, 160, 187], "collected": [17], "on": [18], "consecutive": [19], "patients": [20], "with": [21, 73, 167], "suspected": [22, 181], "retroperitoneal": [23], "sarcoma": [24, 30], "(RPS)": [25], "referred": [26], "a": [28, 50, 141, 164, 178], "tertiary": [29], "center.": [31], "Patients": [32], "underwent": [33], "contrast": [34], "enhanced": [35], "multi-detector": [36], "CT": [37], "scans.": [38], "Radiological": [39, 69], "features": [40], "lesions": [42, 186], "classified": [44, 91], "according": [45, 62], "presence": [48], "fatty": [51], "(Group": [52, 57], "A)": [53], "mass,": [54, 59], "or": [55], "non-fatty": [56], "B)": [58], "both": [60], "subdivided": [61], "homogeneity": [64], "intralesional": [66], "high-contrasted": [67], "appearance.": [68], "classification": [70], "compared": [72], "histopathological": [74], "diagnosis.": [75], "Sensitivity,": [76], "specificity,": [77], "positive/negative": [78], "predictive": [79], "value": [80], "(PPV,": [81], "NPV)": [82], "analyzed.Of": [84], "291": [85], "patients,": [86], "103/291": [87], "(35.4%)": [88], "masses": [89], "in": [92, 98, 107, 114], "Group": [93, 99, 121, 138], "A": [94, 122], "188/291": [96], "(64.6%)": [97], "B.": [100], "Diagnosis": [101], "mesenchymal": [103, 142], "tumor": [104, 113, 143], "obtained": [106], "231/291": [108], "cases": [109], "(79%)": [110], "non-mesenchymal": [112, 189], "60/291": [115], "(21%).": [116], "Sensitivity": [117, 136], "specificity": [119, 147], "for": [123, 140], "liposarcoma": [124, 174], "76.7%": [126], "92.0%;": [128], "PPV": [129, 150], "NPV": [131, 152], "86.4%": [133], "85.6%.": [135], "B": [139], "55.4%": [145], "0%;": [149], "68.1%": [154], "0%.None": [156], "radiological": [158], "criteria": [159], "sufficient": [161], "anticipate": [163], "specific": [165], "diagnosis,": [166], "only": [169], "exception": [170], "well": [172], "differentiated": [173], "angiomyolipoma.": [176], "In": [177], "series": [179], "RPS,": [182], "21%": [183], "finally": [188], "tumors.": [190]}, "authors": ["Carlo Morosi", "Silvia Stacchiotti", "Alfonso Marchian\u00f2", "Alessandro Bianchi", "Stefano Radaelli", "Roberta Sanfilippo", "Chiara Colombo", "Caroline Richardson", "Paola Collini", "Marta Barisella", "Paolo G.

A pelvic radiograph was obtained at entry and after 1 and 2 yr. For each film, the narrowest JSW was measured using a 0.1 mm graduated magnifying glass. The absolute and relative differences between baseline and 1 and 2 yr of follow-up were calculated. We determined the cut-off points above which an absolute or relative decrease in JSW between baseline and 1 and 2 yr of follow-up could be considered relevant on the basis of the predicted need for THA during the remaining years of the study. The need for THA was categorized as 'yes' or 'no'. Thereafter, for each observed change in JSW (0.1 per 0.1 mm or 1% per 1%), the sensitivity and specificity for subsequent THA were calculated. The choice of cut-off was based on maximal sensitivity and specificity, using the graphic representation of correct classification probabilities. In this way it was possible to obtain the best measured JSW threshold with maximal true positive and minimal false positive results.A total of 423 and 385 patients met the criteria for analysis using the decrease in JSW between baseline and 1 and 2 yr respectively. The best cut-off points were absolute decreases in JSW of 0.2 and 0.4 mm and relative decreases in JSW of 15 and 20% after 1 and 2 yr respectively, with corresponding ranges of sensitivity and specificity of 68-75 and 67-78%.This work determined the cut-off above which a change in JSW could be considered clinically relevant in patients with hip OA, on the basis of predicted subsequent need for THA. For validation, similar studies should be conducted in other countries with different health-care systems."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2061135607", "relevance_score": 167.28181,

Guilmette cites studies in dogs, cats and rabbits which found that after 20 days 50% of animals injected with polonium-210 at a concentration of 0.07mCi per kg body mass died. In a 70kg human this translates to 5mCi or 1\u03bcg. At times longer than 20 days the lethal dose is smaller. 3 See, for instance, \u2018Al-Qaeda Plotter Jailed for Life\u2019, BBC News Online, 7 November 2006, http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6123236.stm. 4 Peter D.

For a detailed description of the effects of a dirty bomb see Henry C. Kelly, Prepared Statement Before the Committee on Foreign Relations of the United States Senate, 6 March 2002, in Dirty Bombs and Basement Nukes, pp. 37\u201347. 5 Jason Bennetto, \u2018Mass Panic Was Aim of \u00a370,000 Dirty Bomb\u2019, The Independent Online, 8 November 2006, http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/crime/article1962458.ece. 6 Lou Dobbs Tonight, 1 June 2004, http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0406/01/ldt.00.html. 7 For instance, when talking about the threat from chemical, biological, nuclear and radiological terrorism. See, for example, the UK Home Office\u2019s website http://security.homeoffice.gov.uk/cbrn-resilience/. 8 The number of deaths depends on the source strength, but so does the difficulty of handling, transporting and disseminating the isotope. If a terrorist could obtain a spent fuel rod from a power reactor, and survive the radiation, then this source \u2013 in the million-curie range \u2013 could prove lethal to thousands. However, this scenario is likely beyond the outer limits of the practical. 9 It has also been suggested that victims will be more likely to develop cancer at some point in the future. However, the evidence to support this claim at very low doses of radiation is weak. At any rate, the number of cancers induced by a dirty-bomb attack is likely to be fairly small compared to the \u2018background\u2019 incidence of cancer, which is about 200 in every 1,000 people. See David Bodansky, Nuclear Energy: Principles, Practices and Prospects (Woodbury, NY: American Institute of Physics Press, 1996), pp. 36\u201344; Steven E. Koonin, Prepared Statement Before the Committee on Foreign Relations of the United States Senate, 6 March 2002, in Dirty Bombs and Basement Nukes, pp. 19\u201321. 10 Zimmerman and Loeb, Dirty Bombs, pp. 6\u201310. 11 Ibid., p. 9. 12 Although past research has touched upon these sorts of attacks, there has been no systematic survey of their potential effects \u2013 or even an appreciation of their effectiveness as a weapon of terror. Koonin, Prepared Statement Before the Committee on Foreign Relations of the United States Senate, p. 20 and Zimmerman with Loeb, Dirty Bombs, p. 5, have flagged the danger posed by aerosolised radioisotopes. Michael A. Kelly and Henry C. Levi, \u2018Weapons of Mass Disruption\u2019, Scientific American, November 2002, p. 80, have also discussed them \u2013 but in the context of the increased risk of cancer that could result from the inhalation of radioactive material following a dirty-bomb attack. Moreover, there are similarities between radiological emission devices (a hidden radioactive source designed to irradiate passers-by) discussed by Charles D. Ferguson and William C. Potter with Amy Sands, Leonard S. Spector and Fred Wheling, The Four Faces of Nuclear Terrorism (London: Routlege 2005), p. 259, and the immersion scenarios presented here. 13 Bodansky, Nuclear Energy, pp. 30\u201331. 14 Jesse Helms, Prepared Statement Before the Committee on Foreign Relations of the United States Senate, 6 March 2002, in Dirty Bombs and Basement Nukes, p. 6. 15 Gregory J.

The temperature in a chemical explosion is much less than that of even a small nuclear explosion and the energy release is orders of magnitude smaller. The fireball from a dirty-bomb explosion is therefore less effective at lifting radioactive material to high altitudes where winds are unaffected by buildings and terrain. 18 Apart from Dhiren Barot, Jose Padilla was also accused of plotting to manufacture and detonate a dirty bomb. These charges have, however, been dropped. See Abby Goddnough, \u20182 Sides Give Opening Arguments in Padilla Trial\u2019, New York Times Online, 14 May 2007, http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/14/washington/15cnd-padilla.html?ex=1180843200&en=c33dad289fdd3f83&ei=5070. 19 The security of such sources and the means by which terrorists could acquire them has been discussed in, for example, Charles D. Ferguson, Tahseen Kazi and Judith Perera, Commercial Radioactive Sources: Surveying the Security Risks, Occasional Paper No. 11 (Monterey, CA: Centre for Nonproliferation Studies, Monterey Institute of International Studies, January 2003), http://cns.miis.edu/pubs/opapers/op11/op11.pdf. 20 Ferguson et al., The Four Faces of Nuclear Terrorism, p. 291. 21 The strength of a source is measured in curies (Ci). More specifically, the strength of a source \u2013 its activity \u2013 is the rate at which radioactive decay occurs. A source strength of 1Ci represents 37 billion decays per second (this was chosen for historical reasons, as 1Ci is the activity of 1g of radium-226). 22 Spector and Wehling, The Four Faces of Nuclear Terrorism, p. 270. 23 Ibid., p. 287. 24 IAEA, Strengthening Control over Radioactive Sources in Authorized Use and Regaining Control over Orphan Sources: National Strategies, IAEA-TECDOC-1388 (Vienna: IAEA, 2004), p. 22, http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/te_1388_web.pdf. 25 R.

As discussed elsewhere, this last scenario is one of the most inefficient types of ingestion attacks. D2 values should be revised, taking into account some of the more effective types of I3 attack.

Although one of the reported patients was quadriplegic [1], the other two had post-stroke spasticity and multiple sclerosis, respectively\u2014which would have allowed their physicians to detect new signs, symptoms, neurological deficits, or paralysis due to spinal cord compression or compromise\u2014if those events had occurred [2]. The physicians in all cases made prompt and accurate diagnoses of catheter complications as the cause for loss of ITB effects, and they performed catheter revision or replacement procedures that restored therapeutic efficacy and returned the patients to their previous functional status. In summary, all three patients received timely intervention that led to optimal results. The controversial aspect of the reports was attribution of MRI findings to catheter tip inflammatory mass or \u201cgranuloma.\u201d This phenomenon previously had been described only in patients or experimental animals exposed to intrathecal opioid drugs or pharmacy-compounded drug admixtures [3\u20135]. Consequently, the new reports generated questions and comments among practitioners who care for large numbers of patients on ITB therapy [6,7]. In this article, we will briefly review the state of the current knowledge about inflammatory mass (IM), explain the MRI findings associated with catheter complications in ITB patients, and clarify why the same inflammatory process observed in pain patients and animals exposed to intrathecal opioids is highly unlikely to occur during ITB therapy.\n\nIn 2000\u20132001, one of us (RJC)\u2014in cooperation with clinicians, researchers, and members of a consensus panel that included another of the present authors (TD)\u2014performed the first comprehensive analysis of unpublished animal research, sporadic published reports, and unpublished cases pertaining to intrathecal catheter \u2026"}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2765729115", "relevance_score": 344.88855, "publication_year": 2017, "title": "Automated Radiology Report Summarization Using an Open-Source Natural Language Processing Pipeline", "cited_by_count": 32, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Automatic summarization", "level": 2, "score": 0.8555399}, {"display_name": "Gold standard (test)", "level": 2, "score": 0.6646209}, {"display_name": "Pipeline (software)", "level": 2, "score": 0.6402979}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.5505031}, {"display_name": "Process (computing)", "level": 2, "score": 0.48698744}, {"display_name": "Artificial intelligence", "level": 1, "score": 0.47212562}, {"display_name": "Medical physics", "level": 1, "score": 0.42939082}, {"display_name": "Natural language processing", "level": 1, "score": 0.42391887}, {"display_name": "Information retrieval", "level": 1, "score": 0.41961056}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Diagnostic": [0], "radiologists": [1], "are": [2, 38], "expected": [3], "to": [4, 41, 44, 66, 113, 122, 147, 206], "review": [5, 67], "and": [6, 57, 83, 126, 161, 200], "assimilate": [7], "findings": [8], "from": [9, 74, 130, 158], "prior": [10, 35, 58, 76, 91, 107], "studies": [11, 36], "when": [12, 99], "constructing": [13], "their": [14], "overall": [15, 202], "assessment": [16], "of": [17, 34, 53, 87, 106, 117, 151, 177, 194], "the": [18, 29, 45, 55, 64, 68, 115, 178, 195, 201, 207, 211], "current": [19, 46, 56], "study.": [20], "Radiology": [21], "information": [22], "systems": [23], "facilitate": [24], "this": [25], "process": [26, 79], "by": [27, 49], "presenting": [28], "radiologist": [30, 65], "with": [31], "a": [32, 78, 89, 135, 148], "subset": [33], "that": [37, 80], "more": [39], "likely": [40], "be": [42], "relevant": [43, 90], "study,": [47], "usually": [48], "comparing": [50], "anatomic": [51], "coverage": [52], "both": [54], "studies.": [59, 109], "It": [60], "is": [61, 81, 97, 112], "incumbent": [62], "on": [63], "full": [69], "text": [70], "report": [71, 139, 166], "and/or": [72], "images": [73], "those": [75], "studies,": [77], "time-consuming": [82], "confers": [84], "substantial": [85], "risk": [86, 96], "overlooking": [88], "study": [92], "or": [93, 103, 171], "finding.": [94], "This": [95], "compounded": [98], "patients": [100], "have": [101], "dozens": [102], "even": [104], "hundreds": [105], "imaging": [108], "Our": [110], "goal": [111], "assess": [114], "feasibility": [116], "natural": [118], "language": [119], "processing": [120], "techniques": [121], "automatically": [123, 143], "extract": [124], "asserted": [125], "negated": [127], "disease": [128, 145, 181], "entities": [129], "free-text": [131], "radiology": [132, 156], "reports": [133, 157], "as": [134], "step": [136], "towards": [137], "automated": [138, 165, 196], "summarization.": [140], "We": [141], "compared": [142], "extracted": [144], "mentions": [146, 182], "gold-standard": [149], "set": [150], "manual": [152, 213], "annotations": [153], "for": [154, 175], "50": [155], "CT": [159], "abdomen": [160], "pelvis": [162], "examinations.": [163], "The": [164, 192], "summarization": [167], "pipeline": [168, 197], "found": [169], "perfect": [170], "overlapping": [172], "partial": [173], "matches": [174], "86%": [176], "manually": [179], "annotated": [180], "(sensitivity": [183], "0.86,": [184], "precision": [185], "0.66,": [186], "accuracy": [187, 203], "0.59,": [188], "F1": [189], "score": [190], "0.74).": [191], "performance": [193], "was": [198, 204], "good,": [199], "similar": [205], "interobserver": [208], "agreement": [209], "between": [210], "two": [212], "annotators.": [214]}, "authors": ["Daniel Goff", "Thomas W.

Radiology information systems facilitate this process by presenting the radiologist with a subset of prior studies that are more likely to be relevant to the current study, usually by comparing anatomic coverage of both the current and prior studies. It is incumbent on the radiologist to review the full text report and/or images from those prior studies, a process that is time-consuming and confers substantial risk of overlooking a relevant prior study or finding. This risk is compounded when patients have dozens or even hundreds of prior imaging studies. Our goal is to assess the feasibility of natural language processing techniques to automatically extract asserted and negated disease entities from free-text radiology reports as a step towards automated report summarization. We compared automatically extracted disease mentions to a gold-standard set of manual annotations for 50 radiology reports from CT abdomen and pelvis examinations. The automated report summarization pipeline found perfect or overlapping partial matches for 86% of the manually annotated disease mentions (sensitivity 0.86, precision 0.66, accuracy 0.59, F1 score 0.74). The performance of the automated pipeline was good, and the overall accuracy was similar to the interobserver agreement between the two manual annotators."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2790885993", "relevance_score": 295.94928, "publication_year": 2018, "title": "Embryonal Tumors of the Central Nervous System: <i>From the Radiologic Pathology Archives</i>", "cited_by_count": 32, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Medulloblastoma", "level": 2, "score": 0.88728875}, {"display_name": "Pathology", "level": 1, "score": 0.6726025}, {"display_name": "Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor", "level": 3, "score": 0.67017204}, {"display_name": "Neuroepithelial cell", "level": 4, "score": 0.6152445}, {"display_name": "Terminology", "level": 2, "score": 0.5708811}, {"display_name": "Central nervous system", "level": 2, "score": 0.5025737}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Embryonal": [0], "tumors": [1, 15, 143], "of": [2, 16, 37, 54, 107, 116, 130, 140], "the": [3, 27, 34, 38, 60, 74, 90, 100, 108, 137, 145, 153], "central": [4], "nervous": [5], "system": [6], "(CNS)": [7], "are": [8, 86, 96], "highly": [9], "malignant": [10], "undifferentiated": [11], "or": [12], "poorly": [13], "differentiated": [14], "neuroepithelial": [17], "origin": [18], "and": [19, 57, 82, 114, 144, 159], "have": [20], "been": [21], "defined": [22, 78, 120, 148], "as": [23], "a": [24, 117], "category": [25, 44], "in": [26, 41, 64], "World": [28], "Health": [29], "Organization": [30], "(WHO)": [31], "classification": [32], "since": [33], "first": [35, 75], "edition": [36], "\u201cBlue": [39], "Book\u201d": [40], "1979.": [42], "This": [43], "has": [45], "evolved": [46], "over": [47], "time": [48, 76], "to": [49, 99, 134], "reflect": [50], "our": [51], "ever-improving": [52], "understanding": [53], "tumor": [55, 85, 102, 113, 123, 160], "biology": [56], "behavior.": [58], "With": [59], "most": [61], "recent": [62], "update": [63], "2016,": [65], "many": [66], "previous": [67], "histologic": [68], "diagnoses": [69, 158], "incorporate": [70], "molecular": [71], "parameters": [72], "for": [73, 104, 156], "(genetically": [77], "entities).": [79], "While": [80], "medulloblastoma": [81], "atypical": [83], "teratoid/rhabdoid": [84], "familiar": [87], "carryovers": [88], "from": [89], "2007": [91], "CNS": [92, 110, 141], "WHO": [93], "classification,": [94], "there": [95], "major": [97], "changes": [98], "embryonal": [101, 122, 142], "category:": [103], "example,": [105], "elimination": [106], "term": [109], "primitive": [111], "neuroectodermal": [112], "addition": [115], "new": [118, 146], "genetically": [119], "entity,": [121], "with": [124], "multilayered": [125], "rosettes,": [126], "C19MC-altered.": [127], "The": [128], "purpose": [129], "this": [131], "article": [132], "is": [133], "discuss": [135], "both": [136], "radiologic-pathologic": [138], "features": [139], "molecularly": [147], "types/subtypes": [149], "that": [150], "will": [151], "become": [152], "standard": [154], "classification/terminology": [155], "future": [157], "research.": [161]}, "authors": ["Robert Y.

Materials and methods: The classification is based on anatomical landmarks measured via coronal CT-scan. The patients are divided into 3 Keros categories based on their olfactory fossa depth; Keros 1 (1\u20133 mm), Keros 2 (4\u20137 mm) and Keros 3 (8\u201316 mm). A cross-sectional group of 32 consecutive patients on the hospital radiology database with coronal CT scans were classified according to the Keros system. Results: All the patients fell into one of the three Keros categories. Anatomical associations of the Keros classification suggest that Keros 1 patients have the least risk of intracranial entry whilst Keros 3 patients carry the greatest risk. Conclusion: Keros classification provides an objective assessment of anterior skull base anatomy and can therefore guide the surgeon on the superior extent of medial wall bone removal during orbital decompression. This may help improve the safety profile of the procedure."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2009235575", "relevance_score": 247.5866, "publication_year": 2014, "title": "Strategies for Incorporating Radiology into Early Medical School Curricula", "cited_by_count": 32, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Curriculum", "level": 2, "score": 0.8359103}, {"display_name": "Modalities", "level": 2, "score": 0.76547194}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.6720997}, {"display_name": "Medical physics", "level": 1, "score": 0.50037026}, {"display_name": "Medical imaging", "level": 2, "score": 0.4852252}, {"display_name": "Medical education", "level": 1, "score": 0.46882746}, {"display_name": "Medical school", "level": 2, "score": 0.43416703}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Clinically": [0], "oriented": [1], "material": [2], "is": [3], "being": [4], "incorporated": [5], "increasingly": [6], "early": [7, 17], "into": [8], "medical": [9], "school": [10], "curricula.": [11], "Traditional": [12], "models": [13], "of": [14, 35, 53, 59], "incorporating": [15], "radiology": [16, 54], "on,": [18], "mainly": [19], "as": [20], "an": [21, 45, 56], "adjunct": [22], "to": [23], "pathology": [24], "or": [25], "anatomy": [26], "instruction,": [27], "are": [28], "not": [29], "focused": [30], "on": [31, 50], "learning": [32], "important": [33], "aspects": [34], "clinical": [36], "radiology.": [37], "Medical": [38], "students": [39], "can": [40], "be": [41], "better": [42], "served": [43], "by": [44], "integrated": [46], "curriculum": [47], "that": [48], "focuses": [49], "appropriate": [51], "ordering": [52], "studies,": [55], "intuitive": [57], "understanding": [58, 63], "imaging": [60], "modalities,": [61], "and": [62], "the": [64], "patient": [65], "experience.": [66]}, "authors": ["David M.

Reference levels are also relevant for interventional procedures, in accordance with this Directive, which claims special attention to quality assurance programmes, including quality control and patient dose evaluations for special practices such as interventional radiology, to assess the convenience of corrective action depending on the measured doses. The present paper addresses a method of establishing reference levels in interventional radiology, in the framework of optimisation, discussing the ways of putting forward values with a degree of tolerance, to allow for procedure complexity, depending on patient pathology. The need for several estimators used together, namely fluoroscopy time, total number of images per procedure and dose-area product, is also emphasised, proposing a further skin dose estimate in case of risk of deterministic effects. Finally, a brief summary of principles is given for the correct management of reference levels in interventional radiology."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W1990117929", "relevance_score": 239.14395, "publication_year": 2013, "title": "Radiologic Review of Knee Dislocation: From Diagnosis to Repair", "cited_by_count": 32, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Knee Dislocation", "level": 3, "score": 0.8152839}, {"display_name": "Neurovascular bundle", "level": 2, "score": 0.7466674}, {"display_name": "Orthopedic surgery", "level": 2, "score": 0.66056186}, {"display_name": "Multidisciplinary team", "level": 2, "score": 0.44980305}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.43931767}, {"display_name": "Sports medicine", "level": 2, "score": 0.4252206}, {"display_name": "Multidisciplinary approach", "level": 2, "score": 0.41103885}, {"display_name": "Surgery", "level": 1, "score": 0.37898284}, {"display_name": "Intensive care medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.33433217}, {"display_name": "Physical therapy", "level": 1, "score": 0.32444316}, {"display_name": "Physical medicine and rehabilitation", "level": 1, "score": 0.3230186}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"This": [0], "imaging-based": [1], "article": [2], "systematically": [3], "reviews": [4], "traumatic": [5, 74], "knee": [6, 68, 75], "dislocations.": [7], "After": [8], "completion,": [9], "the": [10, 16, 30, 59, 65, 108, 125], "reader": [11], "should": [12], "be": [13, 71], "familiar": [14, 106], "with": [15, 24, 107, 116], "definition,": [17], "epidemiology,": [18], "cause,": [19], "and": [20, 36, 62, 88, 101, 111], "classification": [21], "schemes": [22], "associated": [23, 115], "these": [25, 117], "injuries,": [26], "as": [27, 29, 44], "well": [28], "importance": [31], "of": [32, 41, 64], "timely": [33], "diagnostic": [34], "imaging": [35, 109], "an": [37, 78, 121], "accurate,": [38], "detailed": [39], "description": [40], "findings,": [42], "particularly": [43], "it": [45], "relates": [46], "to": [47], "MRI": [48], "interpretation.": [49], "Finally,": [50], "information": [51], "our": [52], "orthopedic": [53], "surgical": [54], "colleagues": [55], "consider": [56], "critical": [57], "for": [58], "preoperative": [60], "planning": [61], "reconstruction": [63], "multiple": [66], "ligament": [67], "injury": [69], "will": [70], "discussed.Although": [72], "uncommon,": [73], "dislocations": [76], "are": [77], "important": [79], "potentially": [80], "limb-threatening": [81], "injury,": [82], "which": [83], "if": [84], "not": [85], "emergently": [86], "recognized": [87, 132], "appropriately": [89], "managed,": [90], "can": [91, 119], "result": [92], "in": [93, 124], "significant": [94], "patient": [95], "morbidity,": [96], "joint": [97], "dysfunction,": [98], "chronic": [99], "pain,": [100], "long-term": [102], "disability.": [103], "A": [104], "radiologist": [105], "appearance": [110], "potential": [112], "neurovascular": [113], "complications": [114], "injuries": [118], "play": [120], "integral": [122], "role": [123], "multidisciplinary": [126], "team": [127], "that": [128], "manages": [129], "this": [130], "increasingly": [131], "clinical": [133], "entity.": [134]}, "authors": ["Richard Walker", "David McDougall", "Shamir Patel", "John A.

This development has been the result of the application of CT and ultrasonography to the diagnosis of intra-abdominal inflammatory processes and the use of these imaging modalities to guide percutaneous intervention by the interventional radiologist. The collaboration of interventional radiologists and general surgeons in the management of patients with these perplexing problems has led to important observations regarding the natural history of GI fistulas and to significant advances in the clinical management of many of these problems. Diagnostic radiology techniques have been used for a long time to diagnose and elucidate internal fistulas and to investigate external fistulas. In recent years, the implementation of percutaneous abscess drainage (PAD) as a viable treatment option for many, if not most, intra-abdominal abscesses has yielded unexpected additional findings and benefits. First, a previously unsuspected high incidence of association of intra-abdominal abscesses with enterocavitary fistulas (15% to 44%)11, 18 has been demonstrated on follow-up drainage catheter contrast injection studies (\u201cabscessograms\u201d); second, 80% to 84% of such fistulas have been shown to be amenable to percutaneous management18, 32; and third, similar catheter drainage techniques have been successfully applied to the management of enterocutaneous fistulas following premature surgical drain removal.

There is now a gold standard for assessing human visual decision performance: the ideal Bayesian observer. Unfortunately, there are no mathematical tools to use this gold standard for realistically complex tasks. As an alternative, one can use the optimum linear discriminator (Fisher-Hotelling) model as a silver standard while en route to clinical realism. The goal of scientists working in the area is to develop mathematical models of human observers that will help equipment designers to optimize design trade-offs for specific diagnostic tasks. The current strategy is to modify the Fisher-Hotelling model to include certain limitations of the human observer visual system. The model must be both robust enough and mathematically tractable enough to be used to predict performance for clinical classification and estimation tasks.

Congenital conductive hearing loss is a rare condition; absence of the oval window is an unusual pathogenesis for this type of hearing impairment and can be associated with an anomalous horizontal facial nerve canal. Our goal was to describe the imaging features of congenital absence of the oval window, to determine the frequency with which anomalous development of the horizontal facial nerve canal occurs, and to review the developmental error responsible for this malformation. METHODS: Nine temporal bones in seven patients (5 to 36 years old) were found to have an inadequately formed oval window on high-resolution CT scans; seven ears showed complete lack of oval window formation, and two showed partial absence of the oval window. Records were reviewed for clinical information, and images were examined for associated anomalies. RESULTS: Six of nine ears with abnormal oval window formation showed malposition of the horizontal facial nerve canal. In each of these, the canal was abnormally low, overlying the expected location of the oval window; three of the canals lacked a visible bony covering. Seven of the nine ears were found to have a dysplastic or absent stapes. CONCLUSION: Congenital absence of the oval window can be diagnosed on CT studies. In the present series, this anomaly was associated with a grossly aberrant horizontal facial nerve canal in six of nine involved ears. Familiarity with the developmental sequence of oval window formation fosters an understanding of these anomalies. Preoperative recognition is important clinically, as a low facial nerve will block surgical access to the oval window and its presence will alter patient management."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W1996308428", "relevance_score": 193.90121, "publication_year": 2010, "title": "Building the body: Active learning laboratories that emphasize practical aspects of anatomy and integration with radiology", "cited_by_count": 32, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Relevance (law)", "level": 2, "score": 0.58817434}, {"display_name": "Curriculum", "level": 2, "score": 0.54715645}, {"display_name": "Conceptualization", "level": 2, "score": 0.5207598}, {"display_name": "Context (archaeology)", "level": 2, "score": 0.5193547}, {"display_name": "Anatomy", "level": 1, "score": 0.5187997}, {"display_name": "Human body", "level": 2, "score": 0.43939}, {"display_name": "Human anatomy", "level": 2, "score": 0.430882}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.41267738}, {"display_name": "Medical education", "level": 1, "score": 0.39128965}, {"display_name": "Medical physics", "level": 1, "score": 0.371618}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Active": [0], "learning": [1], "exercises": [2, 39, 56, 79], "were": [3, 57], "developed": [4, 58], "to": [5, 10, 27, 42, 50, 94, 104, 107, 115, 125, 169], "allow": [6], "advanced": [7], "medical": [8], "students": [9, 23, 72, 138], "revisit": [11], "and": [12, 87, 128, 160], "review": [13, 43], "anatomy": [14, 25, 44, 101, 118, 146, 156, 168], "in": [15, 33, 62, 75, 131, 150], "a": [16, 112, 140], "clinically": [17], "meaningful": [18], "context.": [19], "In": [20], "our": [21], "curriculum,": [22], "learn": [24], "two": [26], "three": [28], "years": [29], "before": [30], "they": [31], "participate": [32], "the": [34, 51, 63, 100, 144, 148, 152, 155, 164, 167], "radiology": [35], "clerkship.": [36], "These": [37], "educational": [38], "are": [40, 92, 123], "designed": [41, 68, 124], "content": [45], "while": [46], "highlighting": [47], "its": [48], "relevance": [49, 165], "study": [52], "of": [53, 65, 99, 143, 147, 154, 163, 166], "radiology.": [54], "Laboratory": [55], "using": [59, 102, 111], "inexpensive": [60], "materials": [61], "form": [64], "hands-on": [66], "stations": [67], "for": [69], "use": [70], "by": [71, 110], "working": [73], "together": [74], "small": [76], "groups.": [77], "Station": [78], "include": [80], "model": [81], "building,": [82], "exploring": [83], "relevant": [84], "radiological": [85, 158, 170], "imaging,": [86], "practicing": [88], "clinical": [89], "techniques.": [90], "Students": [91], "encouraged": [93], "move": [95], "from": [96], "abstract": [97], "conceptualization": [98], "models": [103], "applying": [105], "knowledge": [106, 127], "living": [108], "tissues": [109], "portable": [113], "ultrasound": [114], "explore": [116], "superficial": [117], "on": [119, 157], "each": [120], "other.": [121], "Stations": [122], "integrate": [126], "reemphasize": [129], "concepts": [130], "different": [132], "contexts,": [133], "so": [134], "that": [135], "upon": [136], "completion": [137], "have": [139], "reinforced": [141], "understanding": [142], "three-dimensional": [145], "region": [149], "question,": [151], "appearance": [153], "images,": [159], "an": [161], "appreciation": [162], "procedures.": [171]}, "authors": ["Ann Zumwalt", "Rebecca S.

Stations are designed to integrate knowledge and reemphasize concepts in different contexts, so that upon completion students have a reinforced understanding of the three-dimensional anatomy of the region in question, the appearance of the anatomy on radiological images, and an appreciation of the relevance of the anatomy to radiological procedures."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2148378147", "relevance_score": 184.42615, "publication_year": 2005, "title": "Use of Productivity and Financial Indicators for Monitoring Performance in Academic Radiology Departments: U.S. Nationwide Survey", "cited_by_count": 32, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Productivity", "level": 2, "score": 0.78378487}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.34391844}, {"display_name": "Finance", "level": 1, "score": 0.3233288}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"To": [0], "determine": [1, 83, 99], "how": [2, 100], "productivity-": [3], "and": [4, 38, 79, 86, 91, 109, 135, 190, 197, 259], "finance-related": [5], "indicators": [6, 93, 102, 155, 172, 187, 211, 232, 261, 282], "are": [7, 103, 278], "used": [8, 94, 104, 156, 173, 185, 209, 272, 280], "by": [9, 95, 157, 243], "radiology": [10, 80, 96, 158, 245], "departments": [11, 159, 184, 208, 246], "to": [12, 20, 54, 72, 105, 188, 193, 212, 234, 262], "evaluate": [13], "departmental": [14, 107, 264], "performance.The": [15], "study": [16, 37], "met": [17], "the": [18, 33, 36, 48, 58, 84, 112, 167, 181, 231, 236, 240, 248, 269], "criteria": [19], "be": [21, 44], "exempt": [22], "from": [23, 239], "institutional": [24], "review": [25], "board": [26], "approval.": [27], "All": [28], "subjects": [29], "were": [30, 127, 138], "informed": [31], "of": [32, 35, 57, 60, 62, 89, 124, 145, 153, 170, 180, 229, 257, 283], "purpose": [34], "that": [39], "their": [40], "questionnaire": [41], "responses": [42], "would": [43], "kept": [45], "confidential.": [46], "For": [47], "study,": [49], "a": [50, 254], "survey": [51, 69], "was": [52, 70, 120, 142, 160, 174, 233], "sent": [53], "132": [55, 146], "members": [56, 200], "Society": [59], "Chairmen": [61], "Academic": [63], "Radiology": [64], "Departments": [65], "(SCARD)": [66], "nationwide.": [67], "The": [68, 150, 220], "designed": [71], "(a)": [73], "assess": [74, 111], "organizational": [75], "information": [76], "about": [77], "hospital": [78, 195], "departments,": [81, 97], "(b)": [82], "types": [85], "mean": [87, 151, 168], "numbers": [88], "productivity": [90, 154, 186, 218, 258, 273], "financial": [92, 171, 260, 284], "(c)": [98], "these": [101, 210], "influence": [106], "productivity,": [108, 203], "(d)": [110], "reference-standard": [113], "goals": [114], "with": [115], "which": [116], "each": [117], "indicator": [118], "value": [119], "compared.": [121], "A": [122], "total": [123], "77": [125], "variables": [126], "studied.": [128], "Summary": [129], "statistics,": [130], "Spearman": [131], "rank": [132], "correlation": [133], "coefficient,": [134], "chi2": [136], "analyses": [137], "performed.The": [139], "response": [140], "rate": [141], "42%": [143], "(55": [144], "surveyed": [147], "SCARD": [148], "members).": [149], "number": [152, 169], "4.55": [161], "+/-": [162, 176], "2.56": [163], "(standard": [164], "deviation),": [165], "while": [166], "2.89": [175], "1.99.": [177], "Twenty-two": [178], "(40%)": [179], "55": [182], "responding": [183, 227], "monitor": [189], "provide": [191], "feedback": [192], "radiologists,": [194], "leaders,": [196], "technical": [198], "staff": [199], "for": [201], "improved": [202], "but": [204], "only": [205], "11": [206], "(20%)": [207], "compare": [213], "personnel": [214], "performances": [215], "against": [216], "specific": [217], "standards.": [219], "most": [221, 270], "frequent": [222], "goal": [223], "(of": [224], "seven": [225], "[13%]": [226], "departments)": [228], "using": [230], "increase": [235], "examination": [237], "volume": [238, 267], "previous": [241], "year": [242], "5%-10%.Academic": [244], "across": [247], "United": [249], "States": [250], "do": [251], "not": [252], "use": [253], "standardized": [255], "set": [256], "measure": [263], "performance.": [265], "Examination": [266], "is": [268], "frequently": [271], "indicator,": [274], "whereas": [275], "general": [276], "expenses": [277], "commonly": [279], "as": [281], "status.": [285]}, "authors": ["Silvia Ondategui-Parra", "Jui G.

For the study, a survey was sent to 132 members of the Society of Chairmen of Academic Radiology Departments (SCARD) nationwide. The survey was designed to (a) assess organizational information about hospital and radiology departments, (b) determine the types and mean numbers of productivity and financial indicators used by radiology departments, (c) determine how these indicators are used to influence departmental productivity, and (d) assess the reference-standard goals with which each indicator value was compared. A total of 77 variables were studied. Summary statistics, Spearman rank correlation coefficient, and chi2 analyses were performed.The response rate was 42% (55 of 132 surveyed SCARD members). The mean number of productivity indicators used by radiology departments was 4.55 +/- 2.56 (standard deviation), while the mean number of financial indicators used was 2.89 +/- 1.99. Twenty-two (40%) of the 55 responding departments used productivity indicators to monitor and provide feedback to radiologists, hospital leaders, and technical staff members for improved productivity, but only 11 (20%) departments used these indicators to compare personnel performances against specific productivity standards. The most frequent goal (of seven [13%] responding departments) of using the indicators was to increase the examination volume from the previous year by 5%-10%.Academic radiology departments across the United States do not use a standardized set of productivity and financial indicators to measure departmental performance.

osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of CABMAT as a hip preserving surgical approach, preventing femoral head collapse in asymptomatic ONFH. In total, 222 patients (341 hips) with ONFH were treated with CABMAT between April 2003 and March 2013. Based on magnetic resonance imaging, we determined that 119 of these patients had bilateral asymptomatic ONFH (238 hips), and 38 further patients had unilateral asymptomatic ONFH (38 hips). In this series, we retrospectively examined 31 hips in 31 patients with unilateral asymptomatic ONFH treated surgically between 2003 and 2012 and followed up for more than 2 years. Clinical and radiological evaluation were performed immediately before the procedure and at the final follow-up. The two-year follow-up rate among patients with unilateral ONFH was 82% (31/38). Therefore, the present study included 31 patients (19 males and 12 females), with a mean age and follow-up period of 40 and 5.8 years, respectively. Of the 31 asymptomatic hips, 5, 6, 10, and 10 had osteonecrosis of types A, B, C1, and C2, respectively. The diagnosis, classification, and staging of ONFH were based on the 2001 Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) classification. Secondary collapse of the femoral head was observed in 6/10 hips and 5/10 hips with osteonecrosis of types C1 and C2, respectively. Total hip arthroplasty was performed in 9.6% of patients (3/31 hips), at an average of 33 months after surgery. Clinical symptoms improved after surgery, and the secondary collapse rate at a mean of 5.8 years after CABMAT was lower than that reported in several previous studies on the natural course of asymptomatic ONFH.

The most well-understood pitfall in developing these AI models is overfitting, which has, in part, been overcome by optimizing training protocols. However, overfitting is not the only obstacle to the success and generalizability of AI. Underspecification is also a serious impediment that requires conceptual understanding and correction. It is well known that a single AI pipeline, with prescribed training and testing sets, can produce several models with various levels of generalizability. Underspecification defines the inability of the pipeline to identify whether these models have embedded the structure of the underlying system by using a test set independent of, but distributed identically, to the training set. An underspecified pipeline is unable to assess the degree to which the models will be generalizable. Stress testing is a known tool in AI that can limit underspecification and, importantly, assure broad generalizability of AI models. However, the application of stress tests is new in radiologic applications. This report describes the concept of underspecification from a radiologist perspective, discusses stress testing as a specific strategy to overcome underspecification, and explains how stress tests could be designed in radiology\u2014by modifying medical images or stratifying testing datasets. In the upcoming years, stress tests should become in radiology the standard that crash tests have become in the automotive industry.

Kinney"], "abstract": "StatementTHE Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) considers the use of catheter-directed intrathrombus thrombolysis (CDT) as an adjunct to anticoagulant therapy to represent an acceptable initial treatment strategy for carefully selected patients with acute iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The SIR defines acute iliofemoral DVT as complete or partial thrombosis of any part of the iliac vein and/or the common femoral vein with or without associated femoropopliteal DVT, in which symptoms have been present for 14 days or less or for which imaging studies indicate that venous thrombosis has occurred within the past 14 days (1Vedantham S. Grassi C.J. Ferral H. et al.Reporting standards for endovascular treatment of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis.J Vasc Interv Radiol. 2005; 17: 417-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar).RationaleAny treatment for acute proximal DVT must be evaluated on its ability to achieve the following major goals: (a) prevention of pulmonary embolism (PE) and DVT propagation, (b) provision of early symptom relief, and (c) prevention of postthrombotic syndrome (PTS). CDT is a targeted image-guided therapy in which a pharmacologic thrombolytic agent is delivered directly into the venous thrombus through an infusion catheter and/or wire embedded within the thrombosed vein (1Vedantham S. Grassi C.J. Ferral H. et al.Reporting standards for endovascular treatment of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis.J Vasc Interv Radiol. 2005; 17: 417-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 2Semba C.P. Dake M.D. Iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis: aggressive therapy with catheter-directed thrombolysis.Radiology. 1994; 191: 487-494PubMed Google Scholar). The published literature suggests that adjunctive CDT plus anticoagulant therapy is an acceptable initial treatment strategy for many patients with acute iliofemoral DVT for the following reasons:1. Stand-alone anticoagulant therapy fails to prevent PTS in a significant proportion of patients with acute proximal DVT, leading to significant disability, quality of life (QOL) impairment, and socioeconomic costs.PTS is a symptom complex that commonly includes chronic limb edema, heaviness, pain, lifestyle-limiting venous claudication, stasis dermatitis, and, in advanced cases, venous ulcerations (3Kahn S.R. Ginsberg J.S. Relationship between deep venous thrombosis and the postthrombotic syndrome.Arch Intern Med. 2004; 164: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Anticoagulant therapy prevents recurrent ipsilateral DVT, a major risk factor for PTS, and may thereby confer some protection against PTS but only to a limited degree (4Prandoni P. Lensing A.W. Cogo A. et al.The long-term clinical course of acute deep venous thrombosis.Ann Intern Med. 1996; 125: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). Recent prospective studies have found a PTS prevalence of 49%\u201360% within 2 years after a first episode of symptomatic proximal DVT in patients who do not wear compression stockings (5Prandoni P. Lensing A.W. Prins M.H. et al.Below-knee elastic compression stockings to prevent the post-thrombotic syndrome.Ann Intern Med. 2004; 141: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 6Brandjes D.P.

Heijboer H. et al.Randomised trial of effect of compression stockings in patients with symptomatic proximal-vein thrombosis.Lancet. 1997; 349: 759-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Two single-center randomized trials and one large registry suggest that daily use of individually fitted knee-high 30- to 40-mm Hg graduated compression stockings for 2 years after an initial DVT episode can decrease the rate of PTS to approximately 25% (4Prandoni P. Lensing A.W. Cogo A. et al.The long-term clinical course of acute deep venous thrombosis.Ann Intern Med. 1996; 125: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar, 5Prandoni P. Lensing A.W.

However, in actual clinical practice, many patients are not consistently compliant with compression therapy, and some experience difficulty in maintaining therapeutic vitamin K antagonist levels. Hence, the rate of PTS probably exceeds 25% in many populations. Even compliant patients often find long-term compression therapy to be highly inconvenient. In any case, even a 25% incidence of PTS should be of major concern, given the incidence of DVT.PTS often leads to QOL impairment, and the severity of PTS and chronic venous disease have been shown to correlate with the degree of QOL impairment (3Kahn S.R.

In addition, PTS has profound socioeconomic impact via increased medical costs and the indirect costs of work disability. In a Swedish study (10Bergqvist D. Jendteg S.

The direct cost of treatment of chronic venous disease is thought to exceed $300 million yearly in the United States, and it is estimated that 2 million work-days are lost annually as a result of leg ulcers (11Heit J.A. Rooke T.W.

These and other studies confirm the severe clinical disability and high socioeconomic costs associated with PTS, and they highlight its profound impact as a major health care problem for which a better preventive strategy is needed.2. Patients with iliofemoral DVT are at particularly high risk for PTS and late disability.The natural history of iliofemoral DVT is different from that of isolated femoropopliteal DVT. In the latter group, endogenous recanalization of the femoropopliteal venous segment and development of collateral vessels often enhance venous outflow and limit the severity of PTS. By contrast, a thrombosed iliac vein rarely recanalizes via endogenous processes, and persistent venous outflow obstruction often leads to major increases in ambulatory venous pressures (13Meissner M.N. Strandness D.E. Patho-physiology and natural history of deep venous thrombosis.in: Rutherford R.B. Vascular surgery. 5th edition. WB Saunders, Philadelphia2000: 1920-1937Google Scholar). In one study (14Douketis J.D. Crowther M.A. Foster G.A. et al.Does the location of thrombosis determine the risk of disease recurrence in patients with proximal deep vein thrombosis?.Am J Med. 2001; 110: 515-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), recurrent DVT was observed to occur twice as frequently in patients with iliofemoral DVT than in those with infrainguinal DVT. It is therefore not surprising that high rates of PTS-related disability have been observed in cohorts with iliofemoral DVT (8Delis K.T. Bountouroglou D. Mansfield A.O.

In a recent long-term study of patients with iliofemoral DVT (8Delis K.T. Bountouroglou D. Mansfield A.O. Venous claudication in iliofemoral thrombosis: long-term effects on venous hemodynamics, clinical status, and quality of life.Ann Surg. 2004; 239: 118-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), 44% experienced significant venous claudication during a median follow-up of 5 years. The affected limbs performed poorly on plethysmographic physiologic venous testing, and these patients experienced significant clinical impairment as assessed by validated measures of venous disease severity and QOL (8Delis K.T. Bountouroglou D. Mansfield A.O. Venous claudication in iliofemoral thrombosis: long-term effects on venous hemodynamics, clinical status, and quality of life.Ann Surg. 2004; 239: 118-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Specifically, patients with iliofemoral DVT showed poorer physical functioning, physical role, general health, social functioning, and mental functioning than did healthy individuals after adjustment for age and sex.3. Treatment strategies that feature early thrombus removal may prevent PTS.Early removal of venous thrombus has shown strong potential to eliminate venous obstruction, preserve valvular function, maintain late venous patency, and prevent PTS. Small randomized trials (17Arnesen H. Hoiseth A. Ly B.

A recent metaanalysis of randomized trials evaluating any thrombolytic method for acute DVT (20Watson L.I. Armon M.P. Thrombolysis for acute deep vein thrombosis.Cochrane Library. 2005; 1: 1-66Google Scholar) found a significantly reduced risk of PTS in patients who were treated with thrombolysis. The modest sample sizes and the fact that a validated method of measurement of PTS was not used are major limitations of these studies. The invasiveness of surgical thrombectomy and the frequent bleeding complications associated with systemic thrombolysis have precluded their widespread use for acute DVT (21Goldhaber S.Z. Buring J.E.

Kistner R.L. Is there a role for thrombectomy in iliofemoral venous thrombosis?.Semin Vasc Surg. 1996; 9: 34-45PubMed Google Scholar).4. CDT has significant potential to prevent PTS and offers distinct advantages compared with surgical venous thrombectomy, systemic thrombolysis, and anticoagulation alone.Adjunctive CDT has been consistently successful in the removal of thrombus in acute iliofemoral DVT, with approximately 90% of patients experiencing significant thrombolysis (23Vedantham S. Thorpe P.E. Cardella J.F. et al.Quality improvement guidelines for the treatment of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis with use of endovascular thrombus removal.J Vasc Interv Radiol. 2006; 17: 435-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 24Mewissen W.M.

Meissner M.H. et al.Catheter-directed thrombolysis for lower extremity deep venous thrombosis: report of a national multicenter registry.Radiology. 1999; 211: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Unlike surgical thrombectomy, which is also effective in removing thrombus, CDT does not require general anesthesia, a surgical incision, or a prolonged recovery period (19Plate G. Akesson H. Einarsson E. et al.Long-term results of venous thrombectomy combined with a temporary arterio-venous fistula.Eur J Vasc Surg. 1990; 4: 483-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 22Eklof B. Kistner R.L. Is there a role for thrombectomy in iliofemoral venous thrombosis?.Semin Vasc Surg. 1996; 9: 34-45PubMed Google Scholar).The enhanced effectiveness of CDT compared with systemic thrombolysis in reestablishing iliofemoral venous patency is thought to be a result of two main factors: (a) catheter-directed delivery enables a higher intrathrombus drug concentration to be achieved, enhancing thrombus removal and reducing the needed dose; and (b) catheter access into the venous system enables the use of balloon angioplasty and stents to treat underlying venous obstruction that might otherwise predis-pose to recurrent DVT.Three recent comparative studies (25Comerota A.J.

First, in a case\u2013control study of data from a prospective multicenter registry (25Comerota A.J. Throm R.C. Mathias S.D. et al.Catheter-directed thrombolysis for iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis improves health-related quality of life.J Vasc Surg. 2000; 32: 130-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), patients with acute iliofemoral DVT treated with successful CDT and anticoagulation experienced a significantly decreased incidence of PTS and improved health-related QOL at a mean of 20 months of follow-up compared with control individuals who had received anticoagulation alone. Second, a single-center randomized trial (26Elsharawy M. Elzayat E. Early results of thrombolysis vs anticoagulation in iliofemoral venous thrombosis: a randomised clinical trial.Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg. 2002; 24: 209-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) found a significantly higher rate of normal venous function (by Duplex ultrasonography and plethysmography) in patients with acute DVT treated with CDT and anticoagulation than in patients treated with anticoagulation alone (72% vs 12%) at 6 months. Third, a prospective nonrandomized study (27AbuRahma A.F. Perkins S.E. Wulu J.T. et al.Iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis: conventional therapy versus lysis and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting.Ann Surg. 2001; 233: 752-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) found significantly more frequent symptom resolution (defined according to the Clinical, Etiology, Anatomic, Pathophysiology classification system) in patients treated with adjunctive CDT than in those treated with anticoagulation alone (78% vs 30%) at 5-year follow-up.The main disadvantage of adjunctive CDT is thought to be an increased risk of bleeding. A pooled analysis of 19 published studies in which CDT was used for acute DVT was recently performed to estimate the rate of CDT-related major bleeding, defined according to SIR reporting standards as intracranial bleeding or any bleeding severe enough to result in death, surgery, cessation of therapy, or blood transfusion (23Vedantham S. Thorpe P.E. Cardella J.F. et al.Quality improvement guidelines for the treatment of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis with use of endovascular thrombus removal.J Vasc Interv Radiol. 2006; 17: 435-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 28Patel N.

In the studies evaluated, the cumulative major bleeding rate for CDT was 8%, and most bleeding events were confined to the vascular access site. Intracranial bleeding was rare (0.2%).5. Adjunctive CDT is likely to provide faster symptom relief than anticoagulation alone and does not increase the risk of symptomatic PE.No large randomized trials have directly compared the rates of early symptom relief and PE in patients with acute DVT treated with adjunctive CDT versus those treated with anticoagulation alone. However, the proportion of patients with acute iliofemoral DVT who experience significant thrombus regression, reestablishment of venous patency, and early symptom relief with CDT is reported to be approximately 90% (23Vedantham S. Thorpe P.E. Cardella J.F. et al.Quality improvement guidelines for the treatment of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis with use of endovascular thrombus removal.J Vasc Interv Radiol. 2006; 17: 435-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 24Mewissen W.M.

Meissner M.H. et al.Catheter-directed thrombolysis for lower extremity deep venous thrombosis: report of a national multicenter registry.Radiology. 1999; 211: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Proponents of CDT have observed that symptom relief tends to be faster and more complete with adjunctive CDT than with anticoagulant therapy alone.In a pooled analysis of 19 published studies involving 1,046 patients with acute DVT treated with adjunctive CDT, the cumulative incidences of symptomatic PE and PE-related death were 0.9% and 0.1%, respectively (23Vedantham S. Thorpe P.E. Cardella J.F. et al.Quality improvement guidelines for the treatment of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis with use of endovascular thrombus removal.J Vasc Interv Radiol. 2006; 17: 435-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These frequencies do not appear to exceed those in DVT cohorts treated with anticoagulation alone. Hence, there is no evidence to support a contention that PE prevention would be adversely affected by the use of adjunctive CDT.DiscussionSIR supports the use of anticoagulant therapy for DVT and the use of adjunctive CDT or surgical thrombectomy for patients with limb-threatening phlegmasia (29Buller H.R. Hull R.D. Hyers T.M. et al.Antithrombotic therapy for venous thromboembolic disease The Seventh ACCP Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy.Chest. 2004; 126: 401S-428SCrossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). SIR is aware of the controversy within the medical community regarding the use of adjunctive CDT for patients with acute DVT who do not exhibit signs of impending circulatory compromise. SIR recognizes the methodologic limitations of the studies supporting CDT and strongly believes that the execution of a multicenter randomized trial to conclusively quantify the risk\u2013benefit ratio of CDT in patients with acute proximal DVT should be considered an important national health care priority. In the meantime, physicians are still obligated to carefully consider the short-term and long-term consequences of DVT and to recommend the best possible overall treatment strategy to patients based on the currently available, albeit imperfect, evidence. Although there are no large randomized trials to mitigate for or against CDT, the preponderance of the available evidence favors the existence of a clinical benefit to adjunctive CDT for the subset of patients with acute iliofemoral DVT, as described earlier.Given the unanswered questions concerning the risk\u2013benefit ratio of CDT, SIR recommends that physicians use an individualized approach to determine which patients should receive adjunctive CDT as initial therapy for acute iliofemoral DVT. Most importantly, a careful assessment should be performed first to detect clinical factors that might increase the risk of bleeding or diminish the importance of any clinical benefit achieved. After this assessment, ambulatory patients with acute iliofemoral DVT with reasonable life expectancy and a low expected bleeding risk should be presented with a balanced discussion of the long-term risks of PTS and the possible benefits of adjunctive CDT. The risks of CDT, the possible lack of long-term benefits, and the absence of conclusive supportive data should be presented as well. SIR believes that these practices will promote proper use of adjunctive CDT in patients who are most likely to attain clinically meaningful benefits and who are least likely to be harmed by the intervention. StatementTHE Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) considers the use of catheter-directed intrathrombus thrombolysis (CDT) as an adjunct to anticoagulant therapy to represent an acceptable initial treatment strategy for carefully selected patients with acute iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The SIR defines acute iliofemoral DVT as complete or partial thrombosis of any part of the iliac vein and/or the common femoral vein with or without associated femoropopliteal DVT, in which symptoms have been present for 14 days or less or for which imaging studies indicate that venous thrombosis has occurred within the past 14 days (1Vedantham S. Grassi C.J. Ferral H. et al.Reporting standards for endovascular treatment of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis.J Vasc Interv Radiol. 2005; 17: 417-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar).RationaleAny treatment for acute proximal DVT must be evaluated on its ability to achieve the following major goals: (a) prevention of pulmonary embolism (PE) and DVT propagation, (b) provision of early symptom relief, and (c) prevention of postthrombotic syndrome (PTS). CDT is a targeted image-guided therapy in which a pharmacologic thrombolytic agent is delivered directly into the venous thrombus through an infusion catheter and/or wire embedded within the thrombosed vein (1Vedantham S. Grassi C.J. Ferral H. et al.Reporting standards for endovascular treatment of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis.J Vasc Interv Radiol. 2005; 17: 417-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 2Semba C.P. Dake M.D. Iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis: aggressive therapy with catheter-directed thrombolysis.Radiology. 1994; 191: 487-494PubMed Google Scholar). The published literature suggests that adjunctive CDT plus anticoagulant therapy is an acceptable initial treatment strategy for many patients with acute iliofemoral DVT for the following reasons:1. Stand-alone anticoagulant therapy fails to prevent PTS in a significant proportion of patients with acute proximal DVT, leading to significant disability, quality of life (QOL) impairment, and socioeconomic costs.PTS is a symptom complex that commonly includes chronic limb edema, heaviness, pain, lifestyle-limiting venous claudication, stasis dermatitis, and, in advanced cases, venous ulcerations (3Kahn S.R. Ginsberg J.S. Relationship between deep venous thrombosis and the postthrombotic syndrome.Arch Intern Med. 2004; 164: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Anticoagulant therapy prevents recurrent ipsilateral DVT, a major risk factor for PTS, and may thereby confer some protection against PTS but only to a limited degree (4Prandoni P. Lensing A.W. Cogo A. et al.The long-term clinical course of acute deep venous thrombosis.Ann Intern Med. 1996; 125: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). Recent prospective studies have found a PTS prevalence of 49%\u201360% within 2 years after a first episode of symptomatic proximal DVT in patients who do not wear compression stockings (5Prandoni P. Lensing A.W.

Two single-center randomized trials and one large registry suggest that daily use of individually fitted knee-high 30- to 40-mm Hg graduated compression stockings for 2 years after an initial DVT episode can decrease the rate of PTS to approximately 25% (4Prandoni P.

Methods We used the Veterans Aging Cohort Study Virtual Cohort (VACS-VC), an electronic health record-based cohort of 146 530 veterans for whom radiology reports were available ( N =2 977 739). We created a reference standard of radiology reports, represented each report by a feature set of words and Unified Medical Language System concepts, and then developed several support vector machine (SVM) classifiers for falls. We compared mutual information (MI) ranking and embedded feature selection approaches. The SVM classifier with MI feature selection was chosen to classify all radiology reports in VACS-VC. Results Our SVM classifier with MI feature selection achieved an area under the curve score of 97.04 on the test set. When applied to all the radiology reports in VACS-VC, 80 416 of these reports were classified as positive for a fall. Of these, 11 484 were associated with a fall-related external cause of injury code (E-code) and 68 932 were not, corresponding to 29 280 patients with potential fall-related injuries who could not have been found using E-codes. Discussion Feature selection was crucial to improving the classifier\u2019s performance. Feature selection with MI allowed us to select the number of discriminative features to use for classification, in contrast to the embedded feature selection method, in which the number of features is chosen automatically. Conclusion Machine learning is an effective method of identifying patients who have suffered a fall. The development of this classifier supplements the clinical researcher\u2019s toolkit and reduces dependence on under-coded structured electronic health record data."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2022062281", "relevance_score": 262.97992, "publication_year": 2003, "title": "Radiological Evaluation of Hemophilic Arthropathy", "cited_by_count": 31, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Arthropathy", "level": 4, "score": 0.8720163}, {"display_name": "Magnetic resonance imaging", "level": 2, "score": 0.66826594}, {"display_name": "Hemarthrosis", "level": 2, "score": 0.5883545}, {"display_name": "Radiological weapon", "level": 2, "score": 0.54867065}, {"display_name": "Joint disease", "level": 4, "score": 0.5470688}, {"display_name": "Coagulopathy", "level": 2, "score": 0.4647457}, {"display_name": "Synovitis", "level": 3, "score": 0.43813902}, {"display_name": "Haemophilia", "level": 2, "score": 0.42461354}, {"display_name": "Surgery", "level": 1, "score": 0.42161506}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.41150206}, {"display_name": "Osteoarthritis", "level": 3, "score": 0.36250362}, {"display_name": "Arthritis", "level": 2, "score": 0.25225362}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Hemophilia": [0], "leads": [1], "to": [2, 71], "recurrent": [3], "bleeding": [4, 29], "episodes": [5], "in": [6, 9, 14, 96, 119], "joints": [7, 102], "resulting": [8], "a": [10, 75], "severe": [11], "destructive": [12, 117], "arthropathy": [13, 80], "many": [15], "cases.": [16], "Staging": [17], "of": [18, 28, 52, 61, 91, 100, 106], "hemophilic": [19, 76, 79, 101], "joint": [20], "disease": [21], "is": [22], "important": [23], "for": [24], "identifying": [25], "the": [26, 47, 59, 115, 120], "site": [27], "and": [30, 103, 110, 123], "planning": [31], "appropriate": [32], "therapy.": [33], "However,": [34], "classification": [35], "systems": [36], "based": [37, 82], "on": [38, 83], "plain": [39], "X-ray": [40], "findings": [41, 85], "have": [42], "been": [43, 69], "insensitive": [44], "at": [45], "detecting": [46], "earlier,": [48], "possibly": [49], "reversible,": [50], "changes": [51, 118], "synovial": [53], "hyperplasia.": [54], "They": [55], "may": [56], "also": [57], "underestimate": [58], "severity": [60], "cartilage": [62, 122], "damage.": [63], "Magnetic": [64], "resonance": [65], "imaging": [66], "(MRI)": [67], "has": [68], "shown": [70], "more": [72, 97, 107], "accurately": [73], "assess": [74], "joint.": [77], "Tentative": [78], "scales": [81, 93], "MRI": [84], "are": [86], "being": [87], "developed.": [88], "Hopefully,": [89], "use": [90], "these": [92], "will": [94], "result": [95], "consistent": [98], "assessment": [99], "facilitate": [104], "development": [105], "targeted": [108], "treatment": [109], "thus": [111], "prevent": [112], "or": [113], "delay": [114], "later,": [116], "articular": [121], "bone.": [124]}, "authors": ["Ray F.

Clinical decision making is then based on the best current evidence, clinical expertise, and patient values. Substantial progress has been made in the review and dissemination of EBR. Dissemination of EBR within radiology has two critical aspects. The first is increased understanding of the methods required for EBR and of the appropriate use of EBR. The second important component is the dissemination of the data and critical literature reviews necessary to allow use of the EBR approach. Resources available for both EBR methods and EBR data in radiology include societies, journals, medical meetings, Web sites, and textbooks.

All major articles published in Clinical Radiology and British Journal of Radiology in one year were reviewed. The frequency of statistical methods used was as follows: no statistical method or descriptive statistics only 103 (47%), one type of statistical method 67 (31%), and two or more methods 47 (22%). Statistics dealing with basic inference, decisions, contingency tables or correlation/regression techniques were found in 124 (53%) in which a procedure had been used. Advanced statistics including receiver operating characteristics (ROC), odds ratio, regression techniques, multiway ANOVA, and nonparametric ANOVA studies accounted for only 41 (19%) in which a procedure had been used. We conclude that descriptive analysis and basic statistical techniques account for most of the statistical tests reported.

The combination of imaging appearance with clinical features and genetic testing where appropriate permits a confident and accurate diagnosis in the majority of the diseases without recourse for open lung biopsy. The mechanism of cyst development disease is unclear but in some disorders appears to be related to small airways obstruction. These diseases are incurable, with the exception of Langerhans cell histiocytosis which may spontaneously remit or resolve on smoking cessation. Disease progression is unpredictable; in general older patients have a more benign disease, while young patients may progress rapidly to respiratory failure. An understanding of the complications of cystic lung disease and the appearance of disease progression is essential for the management of these patients. A number of these disorders are associated with malignancy, recognition of the potential tumors permits appropriate imaging surveillance. Due to the widespread use of CT, pulmonary cysts are increasingly discovered incidentally in an asymptomatic individual.

Yue", "Angella J. Dow"], "abstract": "In Brief We studied anesthesia times for diagnostic and interventional radiology using anesthesia billing data and paper radiology logbooks. For computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging procedures, we tried to predict future anesthesia times by using historical anesthesia times classified by Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes. By this method, anesthesia times were estimated even less accurately than operating room cases. Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging had many different CPT codes, most rare, and CPT codes reflected organs imaged, not scanning times. However, when, anesthesia times were estimated by expert judgment, face validity and accuracy were good. Lower and upper prediction bounds were also estimated from the expert estimates. For interventional radiology, predicting anesthesia times was challenging because few CPT codes accounted for most cases. Because interventional radiologists scheduled their elective cases into allocated time, the necessary goal was not to estimate the time to complete each case but rather the time to complete each day\u2019s entire series of elective cases including turnover times. We determined the time of day (e.g., 4 pm) up to when interventional radiology could schedule so that on 80% of days the anesthesia team finishes no later than a specified time (e.g., 6 pm). Both diagnostic and interventional radiology results were similarly less accurate when Version 9 of the International Classifications of Diseases\u2019 procedure codes was used instead of CPT. IMPLICATIONS: Anesthesia times for individual diagnostic radiological procedures (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging) can be based on systematic rules from the facility\u2019s experts. In contrast, a series of interventional radiological procedures performed on the same day can be scheduled consecutively up to a calculated time (e.g., 4 pm), assuring that the anesthesia team usually finishes before the end of the workday (6 pm)."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2015820381", "relevance_score": 210.14818, "publication_year": 1970, "title": "X-Ray Sensitometer for Screen-Film Combinations Used in Medical Radiology", "cited_by_count": 31, "concepts": [{"display_name": "X-ray", "level": 2, "score": 0.65841126}, {"display_name": "Reproducibility", "level": 2, "score": 0.63312274}, {"display_name": "Radiography", "level": 2, "score": 0.6249013}, {"display_name": "Nuclear medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.5737176}, {"display_name": "Optics", "level": 1, "score": 0.5258073}, {"display_name": "Radiation", "level": 2, "score": 0.50005484}, {"display_name": "X-ray tube", "level": 4, "score": 0.4928429}, {"display_name": "Filtration (mathematics)", "level": 2, "score": 0.43218812}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.21481365}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"An": [0], "x-ray": [1, 20, 42, 49], "sensitometer": [2], "is": [3, 31], "used": [4, 62], "to": [5, 81], "measure": [6], "the": [7, 38, 73], "characteristic": [8, 90], "curve": [9, 91], "of": [10, 37, 92], "radiographic": [11], "films": [12], "exposed": [13], "with": [14, 63, 95], "fluorescent": [15], "intensifying": [16], "screens.": [17], "During": [18], "exposure,": [19], "kilovoltage,": [21], "tube": [22], "current,": [23], "and": [24], "exposure": [25, 85], "times": [26], "remain": [27], "constant.": [28], "Radiation": [29], "intensity": [30], "varied": [32], "by": [33], "automatic,": [34], "stepwise": [35], "increase": [36], "focus-film": [39], "distance.": [40], "The": [41], "source": [43], "utilized": [44], "a": [45, 88], "conventional": [46], "radiation": [47], "therapy": [48], "machine": [50], "modified": [51], "for": [52], "necessary": [53], "output": [54], "stability.": [55], "Normally,": [56], "80": [57], "kVp": [58], "x": [59], "rays": [60], "are": [61], "0.5": [64], "mm": [65, 69], "Cu": [66], "+": [67], "3": [68], "Al": [70], "filtration": [71], "at": [72], "tube.": [74], "Focal": [75], "spot-film": [76], "distance": [77], "ranges": [78], "from": [79], "10": [80], "126": [82], "inches.": [83], "This": [84], "latitude": [86], "gives": [87], "complete": [89], "film-screen": [93], "systems": [94], "excellent": [96], "reproducibility.": [97]}, "authors": ["Arthur G.

Using a validated method for radiological analysis, we assessed the relevance of these signs to predict intra-articular lesions in 93 patients undergoing surgery for FAI. A logistic regression model to predict chondral damage showed that an acetabular retroversion index (ARI) &gt; 20%, a derivative of the well-known cross-over sign, was an independent predictor (p = 0.036). However, ARI was less significant than the T\u00f6nnis classification (p = 0.019) and age (p = 0.031) in the same model. ARI was unable to discriminate between grades of chondral lesions, while the type of cam lesion (p = 0.004) and age (p = 0.047) were able to. Other widely recognised signs of acetabular retroversion, such as the ischial spine sign, the posterior wall sign or the cross-over sign were irrelevant according to our analysis. Regardless of its secondary predictive role, an ARI &gt; 20% appears to be the most clinically relevant radiological sign of acetabular retroversion in symptomatic patients with FAI.

Three-dimensional C3\u2013C5 and C3\u2013C4 finite element (FE) models were used to analyze biomechanical responses under compression and extension moments. Objective. To validate our models against other published FE models and experimental studies and improve our understanding of the mechanism of spinal cord injury without radiologic abnormality (SCIWORA) in cervical spine. Summary of Background Data. The underlying mechanism for SCIWORA remains unclear. We hypothesized that the incidence of SCIWORA was associated with facet joint morphology and bony pincers mechanism. Methods. FE models were constructed using data from computed tomography scans of the cervical spine of a healthy young man. The C3\u2013C5 FE models consisted of bony vertebra, articulating facets, and intervertebral disc. Facet surfaces were oriented at 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, and 60\u00b0 from the transverse plane. These models were constrained in all degrees of freedom at the C5 inferior vertebral body and a uniform axial displacement of 1 mm was applied to the superior nodes of C3. Three model versions changed to C3\u2013C4 models with ligaments. The C4 inferior-most bony nodes were constrained, whereas the top of the C3 superior-most bony nodes were left unconstrained. These models were subjected to an axial compression load of 73.6 N with extension moments (1.8 Nm) applied to the upper bony section C3 vertebra. The predicted responses were compared with published results. Results. The response under axial compression was validated and corresponded closely with published results. Under sagittal moment, the C3\u2013C4 FE model with 60\u00b0 facet was the most flexible in extension (4.22\u00b0). Total translation was highest for the model with 60\u00b0 facet. Conclusion. The load displacement response of C3\u2013C5 FE models was in agreement with published data. We confirmed that the C3\u2013C4 FE model with 60\u00b0 facet was the most susceptible to SCIWORA and that the bony pincers mechanism was dependent on facet joint inclination. These models were useful for predicting mechanical behaviors at the time of cervical spine injuries. Extension motion increased with the increase in facet angle orientation to the transverse plane. We confirmed that the C3\u2013C4 finite element model with 60\u00b0 facet was most susceptible to spinal cord injury without radiologic abnormality."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2140173693",

investigate the risk factors predicting radiological progression in silicosis in a prospective cohort study of patients with silicosis who were previously exposed to silica from granite dust.From among a total of 260 patients with silicosis contracted from granite work, 141 with available serial chest x ray films of acceptable quality taken over a period of 2 to 17 (mean 7.5) years, were selected for study. Ninety four (66.7%) had ended exposure 5 or more years previously (mean 10.1 years, maximum 28 years). Radiological progression was assessed by paired comparison of the initial and most recent radiographs, with two or more steps of increase in profusion of small opacities according to the 12 point scale of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) classification of radiographs of pneumoconiosis, taken from the majority reading by a panel of three independent readers.Overall, 37% of patients with silicosis had radiological evidence of progression. From the initial radiographs, 24 (31.6%) of those with radiological profusion category 1, 15 (37.5%) of those with radiological profusion category 2, and 13 (52%) of those with complicated silicosis (including all seven with category 3 profusion of small opacities) showed radiological progression. As expected, progression was more likely to be found after longer periods of follow up (the interval between the two chest x ray films) with a 20% increased odds of progression for every additional year of follow up. After adjustment for varying intervals of follow up, the probability of radiological progression was found to be significant if large opacities were present in the initial chest x ray film. Progression was also less likely to be found among those who had ended exposure to silica longer ago, although the result was of borderline significance (p=0.07). Tuberculosis was also associated with increased likelihood of progression (borderline significance).There is a high probability of radiological progression in silicosis after high levels of exposure to granite dust among workers who were followed up for up to 17 years. A significant risk factor is the extent of radiological opacities in the initial chest x ray film. The probability of progression is also likely to be reduced with longer periods after the end of exposure."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2165453288", "relevance_score": 198.88394, "publication_year": 1998, "title": "Economic analyses of radiological procedures: A methodological evaluation of the medical literature", "cited_by_count": 31, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Radiological weapon", "level": 2, "score": 0.90454036}, {"display_name": "Economic evaluation", "level": 2, "score": 0.4970608}, {"display_name": "Psychological intervention", "level": 2, "score": 0.46045426}, {"display_name": "Discounting", "level": 2, "score": 0.42866802}, {"display_name": "Medical physics", "level": 1, "score": 0.41571748}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.2504809}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Increasing": [0], "pressure": [1], "to": [2, 9, 42, 96, 169, 196], "curb": [3], "health": [4], "care": [5], "costs": [6, 146], "has": [7], "led": [8], "considerable": [10], "interest": [11], "in": [12, 29, 54, 181], "economic": [13, 22, 48, 72, 85, 111, 187, 236], "analyses,": [14], "including": [15], "both": [16, 30], "cost-effectiveness": [17], "and": [18, 33, 109, 115, 160, 205, 219], "cost-benefit": [19], "analyses.": [20], "Numerous": [21], "analyses": [23, 49, 73, 188, 237], "of": [24, 38, 47, 50, 74, 106, 117, 126, 139, 189, 216, 238], "radiological": [25, 51, 75, 110, 176, 190], "procedures": [26, 52, 240], "have": [27], "appeared": [28], "the": [31, 44, 55, 60, 66, 107, 118, 175, 178, 182, 214, 229], "radiology": [32, 239], "non-radiology": [34, 56], "literature.": [35], "The": [36, 100, 165, 201], "objective": [37], "this": [39], "study": [40, 172], "was": [41, 88, 231], "evaluate": [43], "methodological": [45, 98, 199, 246], "quality": [46], "published": [53], "medical": [57, 67, 108, 183], "literature": [58, 69, 82, 114, 184], "during": [59], "years": [61], "1990": [62], "1995.Original": [63], "investigations": [64], "from": [65, 79, 104], "(non-radiological)": [68], "that": [70, 173, 185], "include": [71], "interventions": [76], "were": [77, 102, 167], "identified": [78], "a": [80, 170], "computerized": [81], "search.": [83], "Each": [84], "analysis": [86, 112, 127, 163, 217], "article": [87], "evaluated": [89, 174], "by": [90], "two": [91], "independent": [92], "reviewers": [93, 230], "for": [94], "adherence": [95], "ten": [97, 198], "criteria.": [99, 200], "criteria": [101, 209, 222], "derived": [103], "review": [105], "methodology": [113], "consisted": [116], "following:": [119], "(1)": [120], "Comparative": [121], "options": [122, 207], "stated;": [123, 142], "(2)": [124], "perspective": [125, 215], "defined;": [128], "(3)": [129], "outcome": [130], "measure": [131, 153], "identified;": [132], "(4)": [133], "cost": [134, 140, 202], "data": [135, 141, 203], "included;": [136, 147], "(5)": [137], "source": [138], "(6)": [143], "long": [144], "term": [145], "(7)": [148], "discounting": [149, 220], "employed;": [150], "(8)": [151], "summary": [152], "provided;": [154], "(9)": [155], "incremental": [156], "computation": [157], "method": [158], "used;": [159], "(10)": [161], "sensitivity": [162], "performed.": [164], "results": [166], "compared": [168], "previous": [171], "literature.Of": [177], "56": [179], "articles": [180], "included": [186], "procedures,": [191], "only": [192], "eight": [193], "(14%)": [194], "conformed": [195], "all": [197], "(98%)": [204], "comparative": [206], "(89%)": [208], "exhibited": [210], "high": [211], "compliance,": [212], "while": [213], "(25%)": [218], "(32%)": [221], "had": [223], "relatively": [224], "low": [225], "compliance.": [226], "Agreement": [227], "between": [228], "excellent": [232], "(kappa": [233], "=": [234], "0.88).Published": [235], "usually": [241], "do": [242], "not": [243], "meet": [244], "accepted": [245], "standards.": [247]}, "authors": ["C.

Numerous economic analyses of radiological procedures have appeared in both the radiology and non-radiology literature. The objective of this study was to evaluate the methodological quality of economic analyses of radiological procedures published in the non-radiology medical literature during the years 1990 1995.Original investigations from the medical (non-radiological) literature that include economic analyses of radiological interventions were identified from a computerized literature search. Each economic analysis article was evaluated by two independent reviewers for adherence to ten methodological criteria. The criteria were derived from review of the medical and radiological economic analysis methodology literature and consisted of the following: (1) Comparative options stated; (2) perspective of analysis defined; (3) outcome measure identified; (4) cost data included; (5) source of cost data stated; (6) long term costs included; (7) discounting employed; (8) summary measure provided; (9) incremental computation method used; and (10) sensitivity analysis performed. The results were compared to a previous study that evaluated the radiological literature.Of the 56 articles in the medical literature that included economic analyses of radiological procedures, only eight (14%) conformed to all ten methodological criteria. The cost data (98%) and comparative options (89%) criteria exhibited high compliance, while the perspective of analysis (25%) and discounting (32%) criteria had relatively low compliance. Agreement between the reviewers was excellent (kappa = 0.88).Published economic analyses of radiology procedures usually do not meet accepted methodological standards."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2007402939", "relevance_score": 192.94621, "publication_year": 2016, "title": "Content-Based Image Retrieval by Metric Learning From Radiology Reports: Application to Interstitial Lung Diseases", "cited_by_count": 31, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Image retrieval", "level": 3, "score": 0.72035944}, {"display_name": "Content-based image retrieval", "level": 4, "score": 0.6077293}, {"display_name": "Metric (unit)", "level": 2, "score": 0.5687405}, {"display_name": "Similarity (geometry)", "level": 3, "score": 0.53087926}, {"display_name": "Automatic image annotation", "level": 4, "score": 0.51704866}, {"display_name": "Information retrieval", "level": 1, "score": 0.5120488}, {"display_name": "Artificial intelligence", "level": 1, "score": 0.47057742}, {"display_name": "Annotation", "level": 2, "score": 0.44408208}, {"display_name": "Medical imaging", "level": 2, "score": 0.44041333}, {"display_name": "Image (mathematics)", "level": 2, "score": 0.37673107}, {"display_name": "Pattern recognition (psychology)", "level": 2, "score": 0.3702203}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Content-based": [0], "image": [1, 41, 144, 154], "retrieval": [2, 119], "(CBIR)": [3], "is": [4, 58], "a": [5, 59, 81, 137, 172], "search": [6], "technology": [7], "that": [8, 20, 84, 141, 195], "could": [9], "aid": [10], "medical": [11, 51, 160, 232], "diagnosis": [12], "by": [13, 50, 116], "retrieving": [14], "and": [15, 55, 61, 156, 165, 199, 217, 234], "presenting": [16], "earlier": [17], "reported": [18], "cases": [19], "are": [21, 132], "related": [22], "to": [23, 38, 43, 70, 121, 135, 147, 227], "the": [24, 48, 66, 87, 90, 103, 112, 123, 143, 208, 220, 237], "one": [25], "being": [26], "diagnosed.": [27], "To": [28], "retrieve": [29], "relevant": [30], "cases,": [31], "CBIR": [32, 72, 150, 189, 228, 240], "systems": [33, 151, 229], "depend": [34], "on": [35], "supervised": [36, 67], "learning": [37, 68, 139], "map": [39], "low-level": [40], "contents": [42], "high-level": [44], "diagnostic": [45], "concepts.": [46], "However,": [47], "annotation": [49, 205], "doctors": [52], "for": [53, 203], "training": [54], "evaluation": [56], "purposes": [57], "difficult": [60], "time-consuming": [62], "task,": [63], "which": [64], "restricts": [65], "phase": [69], "specific": [71], "problems": [73], "of": [74, 105, 159, 174, 178, 211, 239], "well-defined": [75], "clinical": [76, 242], "applications.": [77], "This": [78], "paper": [79], "proposes": [80], "new": [82], "technique": [83], "automatically": [85], "learns": [86], "similarity": [88], "between": [89, 114, 126], "several": [91], "exams": [92], "from": [93, 97, 168], "textual": [94, 124, 148, 169], "distances": [95, 125, 131], "extracted": [96], "radiology": [98, 128, 212], "reports,": [99], "thereby": [100], "successfully": [101], "reducing": [102], "number": [104], "annotations": [106, 161], "needed.": [107], "Our": [108], "method": [109, 186], "first": [110], "infers": [111], "relation": [113], "patients": [115, 179], "using": [117, 171], "information": [118], "techniques": [120], "determine": [122], "patient": [127], "reports.": [129], "These": [130], "subsequently": [133], "used": [134], "supervise": [136], "metric": [138], "algorithm,": [140], "transforms": [142], "space": [145], "accordingly": [146], "distances.": [149], "with": [152, 164, 180, 193], "different": [153, 157, 231], "descriptions": [155], "levels": [158], "were": [162], "evaluated,": [163], "without": [166], "supervision": [167], "distances,": [170], "database": [173], "computer": [175], "tomography": [176], "scans": [177], "interstitial": [181], "lung": [182], "diseases.": [183], "The": [184], "proposed": [185, 221], "consistently": [187], "improves": [188], "mean": [190], "average": [191], "precision,": [192], "improvements": [194], "can": [196, 223], "reach": [197], "38%,": [198], "more": [200], "marked": [201], "gains": [202], "small": [204], "sets.": [206], "Given": [207], "overall": [209], "availability": [210], "reports": [213], "in": [214, 230, 241], "picture": [215], "archiving": [216], "communication": [218], "systems,": [219], "approach": [222], "be": [224], "broadly": [225], "applied": [226], "problems,": [233], "may": [235], "facilitate": [236], "introduction": [238], "practice.": [243]}, "authors": ["J.

To retrieve relevant cases, CBIR systems depend on supervised learning to map low-level image contents to high-level diagnostic concepts. However, the annotation by medical doctors for training and evaluation purposes is a difficult and time-consuming task, which restricts the supervised learning phase to specific CBIR problems of well-defined clinical applications. This paper proposes a new technique that automatically learns the similarity between the several exams from textual distances extracted from radiology reports, thereby successfully reducing the number of annotations needed. Our method first infers the relation between patients by using information retrieval techniques to determine the textual distances between patient radiology reports. These distances are subsequently used to supervise a metric learning algorithm, that transforms the image space accordingly to textual distances. CBIR systems with different image descriptions and different levels of medical annotations were evaluated, with and without supervision from textual distances, using a database of computer tomography scans of patients with interstitial lung diseases. The proposed method consistently improves CBIR mean average precision, with improvements that can reach 38%, and more marked gains for small annotation sets. Given the overall availability of radiology reports in picture archiving and communication systems, the proposed approach can be broadly applied to CBIR systems in different medical problems, and may facilitate the introduction of CBIR in clinical practice."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2155637051", "relevance_score": 192.06856, "publication_year": 2013, "title": "Informatics in Radiology: Dual-Energy Electronic Cleansing for Fecal-Tagging CT Colonography", "cited_by_count": 31, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Lumen (anatomy)", "level": 2, "score": 0.5439068}, {"display_name": "Dual energy", "level": 4, "score": 0.5056281}, {"display_name": "Low energy", "level": 2, "score": 0.48247626}, {"display_name": "Feces", "level": 2, "score": 0.47253636}, {"display_name": "Virtual colonoscopy", "level": 5, "score": 0.44397473}, {"display_name": "Computed tomographic", "level": 3, "score": 0.4431116}, {"display_name": "Nuclear medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.4280431}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.29631194}, {"display_name": "Colonoscopy", "level": 4, "score": 0.26247174}, {"display_name": "Computed tomography", "level": 2, "score": 0.21825561}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Electronic": [0], "cleansing": [1, 68, 160], "(EC)": [2], "is": [3, 45, 86, 104], "an": [4], "emerging": [5], "technique": [6, 194], "for": [7, 110, 159], "the": [8, 33, 36, 74, 89, 93, 131, 136, 139, 148, 155, 162, 177, 187, 196, 201, 218], "removal": [9], "of": [10, 28, 35, 56, 72, 78, 96, 118, 161, 190, 203, 210, 217], "tagged": [11, 112, 142, 163], "fecal": [12, 113, 143, 164, 185], "materials": [13, 114], "at": [14, 99], "fecal-tagging": [15, 42, 58, 121], "computed": [16], "tomographic": [17], "(CT)": [18], "colonography.": [19], "However,": [20], "existing": [21], "EC": [22, 52, 128, 170, 191, 204, 225], "methods": [23], "may": [24], "generate": [25], "various": [26, 116], "types": [27, 117], "artifacts": [29, 69, 219], "that": [30, 53, 214], "severely": [31], "impair": [32], "quality": [34, 202], "cleansed": [37, 212], "CT": [38, 43, 59, 122], "colonographic": [39, 60, 123], "images.": [40, 124], "Dual-energy": [41], "colonography": [44], "regarded": [46], "as": [47], "a": [48, 97, 105, 167, 211], "next-generation": [49], "imaging": [50], "modality.": [51], "makes": [54], "use": [55], "dual-energy": [57, 79, 82, 127, 169], "images": [61, 209], "promises": [62, 206], "to": [63, 133, 198, 207], "be": [64], "effective": [65, 108], "in": [66, 92, 176, 183], "reducing": [67], "by": [70], "means": [71], "applying": [73], "material": [75, 98], "decomposition": [76], "capability": [77], "CT.": [80], "The": [81], "index": [83], "(DEI),": [84], "which": [85], "calculated": [87], "from": [88, 115], "relative": [90], "change": [91], "attenuation": [94], "values": [95], "two": [100], "different": [101], "photon": [102], "energies,": [103], "reliable": [106], "and": [107, 145, 152, 180, 205], "indicator": [109], "differentiating": [111], "tissues": [119], "on": [120], "A": [125], "DEI-based": [126], "scheme": [129], "uses": [130], "DEI": [132], "help": [134, 172], "differentiate": [135], "colonic": [137, 149, 157], "lumen\u2014including": [138], "luminal": [140], "air,": [141], "materials,": [144, 186], "air-tagging": [146, 178], "mixture\u2014from": [147], "soft-tissue": [150], "structures,": [151], "then": [153], "segments": [154], "entire": [156], "lumen": [158], "materials.": [165], "As": [166], "result,": [168], "can": [171], "identify": [173], "partial-volume": [174], "effects": [175], "mixture": [179], "inhomogeneous": [181], "tagging": [182], "residual": [184], "major": [188], "causes": [189], "artifacts.": [192], "This": [193], "has": [195], "potential": [197], "significantly": [199], "improve": [200], "provide": [208], "colon": [213], "are": [215], "free": [216], "commonly": [220], "observed": [221], "with": [222], "conventional": [223], "single-energy": [224], "methods.": [226], "\u00a9": [227], "RSNA,": [228], "2013": [229]}, "authors": ["Wenli Cai", "Se Hyung Kim", "June-Goo Lee", "Hiroyuki Yoshida"], "abstract": "Electronic cleansing (EC) is an emerging technique for the removal of tagged fecal materials at fecal-tagging computed tomographic (CT) colonography. However, existing EC methods may generate various types of artifacts that severely impair the quality of the cleansed CT colonographic images. Dual-energy fecal-tagging CT colonography is regarded as a next-generation imaging modality. EC that makes use of dual-energy fecal-tagging CT colonographic images promises to be effective in reducing cleansing artifacts by means of applying the material decomposition capability of dual-energy CT. The dual-energy index (DEI), which is calculated from the relative change in the attenuation values of a material at two different photon energies, is a reliable and effective indicator for differentiating tagged fecal materials from various types of tissues on fecal-tagging CT colonographic images. A DEI-based dual-energy EC scheme uses the DEI to help differentiate the colonic lumen\u2014including the luminal air, tagged fecal materials, and air-tagging mixture\u2014from the colonic soft-tissue structures, and then segments the entire colonic lumen for cleansing of the tagged fecal materials. As a result, dual-energy EC can help identify partial-volume effects in the air-tagging mixture and inhomogeneous tagging in residual fecal materials, the major causes of EC artifacts. This technique has the potential to significantly improve the quality of EC and promises to provide images of a cleansed colon that are free of the artifacts commonly observed with conventional single-energy EC methods. \u00a9 RSNA, 2013"}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2057246370", "relevance_score": 188.68704, "publication_year": 2008, "title": "Urogenital tuberculosis: patient classification in seven different groups according to clinical and radiological presentation", "cited_by_count": 31, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Tuberculosis", "level": 2, "score": 0.8036108}, {"display_name": "Genitourinary system", "level": 2, "score": 0.6636702}, {"display_name": "Urogenital tuberculosis", "level": 3, "score": 0.54027134}, {"display_name": "Kidney", "level": 2, "score": 0.52097136}, {"display_name": "Surgery", "level": 1, "score": 0.4738196}, {"display_name": "Renal function", "level": 2, "score": 0.45514446}, {"display_name": "Urinary system", "level": 2, "score": 0.4346141}, {"display_name": "Internal medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.2761774}, {"display_name": "Pathology", "level": 1, "score": 0.23970202}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"PURPOSE:": [0], "To": [1], "describe": [2], "and": [3, 16, 98, 223], "classify": [4], "80": [5, 22], "cases": [6, 113], "of": [7, 13, 101, 105, 216, 245], "urogenital": [8, 37, 218], "tuberculosis": [9, 38, 138, 175, 184, 204, 211], "in": [10, 46, 192], "seven": [11, 47], "groups": [12], "similar": [14, 230], "clinical": [15, 222], "radiological": [17], "presentation.": [18, 225], "MATERIALS": [19], "AND": [20], "METHODS:": [21], "patients": [23, 43, 89, 107, 134, 150, 167, 182, 199], "(56": [24], "males,": [25], "70%;": [26], "median": [27], "age": [28, 31], "34": [29], "years;": [30], "range": [32], "12": [33], "to": [34, 174, 229], "75)": [35], "with": [36, 72, 96, 118, 139, 155, 176, 189, 220, 233], "were": [39, 44], "retrospectively": [40], "reviewed.": [41], "The": [42], "divided": [45], "groups:": [48], "1)": [49, 86], "Bilateral": [50], "parenchymatous": [51, 93], "renal": [52, 64, 73, 94, 137, 171, 207], "lesions;": [53], "2)": [54, 110], "No": [55], "or": [56, 120, 143, 160, 202], "minimal": [57, 119], "changes": [58], "on": [59, 77, 185], "radiographic": [60, 122, 224], "examination;": [61], "3)": [62, 131], "Unilateral": [63], "tuberculosis;": [65], "4)": [66, 147], "Contracted": [67, 70], "bladder;": [68], "5)": [69, 164], "bladder": [71, 153], "failure;": [74], "6)": [75, 179], "Tuberculosis": [76], "a": [78, 186, 213], "transplanted": [79, 187], "kidney;": [80], "7)": [81, 196], "Isolated": [82], "genital": [83], "tuberculosis.": [84, 103], "RESULTS:": [85], "Seven": [87], "(8.8%)": [88], "had": [90, 108, 114, 135, 151, 168, 183, 200], "multiple": [91], "bilateral": [92], "lesions": [95], "fever": [97], "malaise,": [99], "characteristic": [100], "miliary": [102], "Three": [104], "these": [106], "AIDS.": [109], "Six": [111], "(7.5%)": [112], "an": [115], "early": [116, 239], "diagnosis,": [117], "no": [121], "lesions.": [123], "Two": [124], "did": [125], "not": [126], "have": [127], "any": [128], "urologic": [129], "symptoms.": [130], "Twelve": [132], "(15%)": [133], "unilateral": [136, 156], "partial": [140, 157], "(1": [141, 158], "case)": [142, 159], "total": [144, 161], "non-function": [145, 162], "kidney.": [146, 163], "Thirty-seven": [148], "(46.3%)": [149], "contracted": [152, 177], "associated": [154, 206], "Ten": [165], "(12.5%)": [166], "end": [169], "stage": [170, 235], "disease": [172, 215, 234], "due": [173], "bladder.": [178], "Four": [180, 197], "(5.0%)": [181, 198], "kidney,": [188], "graft": [190], "loss": [191], "half": [193], "the": [194, 217, 242, 246], "cases.": [195], "prostate": [201], "epididymis": [203], "without": [205], "lesion.": [208], "CONCLUSIONS:": [209], "Urogenital": [210], "is": [212, 236, 241], "destructive": [214], "tract": [219], "variable": [221], "A": [226], "classification": [227], "according": [228], "patterns": [231], "correlating": [232], "feasible": [237], "although": [238], "diagnosis": [240], "only": [243], "prevention": [244], "most": [247], "severe": [248], "forms.": [249]}, "authors": ["Andr\u00e9 Avarese de Figueiredo", "Ant\u00f4nio Marmo Lucon", "Cristiano Mendes Gomes", "Miguel Srougi"], "abstract": "PURPOSE: To describe and classify 80 cases of urogenital tuberculosis in seven groups of similar clinical and radiological presentation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 80 patients (56 males, 70%; median age 34 years; age range 12 to 75) with urogenital tuberculosis were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were divided in seven groups: 1) Bilateral parenchymatous renal lesions; 2) No or minimal changes on radiographic examination; 3) Unilateral renal tuberculosis; 4) Contracted bladder; 5) Contracted bladder with renal failure; 6) Tuberculosis on a transplanted kidney; 7) Isolated genital tuberculosis. RESULTS: 1) Seven (8.8%) patients had multiple bilateral parenchymatous renal lesions with fever and malaise, characteristic of miliary tuberculosis. Three of these patients had AIDS. 2) Six (7.5%) cases had an early diagnosis, with minimal or no radiographic lesions. Two did not have any urologic symptoms. 3) Twelve (15%) patients had unilateral renal tuberculosis with partial (1 case) or total non-function kidney. 4) Thirty-seven (46.3%) patients had contracted bladder associated with unilateral partial (1 case) or total non-function kidney. 5) Ten (12.5%) patients had end stage renal disease due to tuberculosis with contracted bladder. 6) Four (5.0%) patients had tuberculosis on a transplanted kidney, with graft loss in half the cases. 7) Four (5.0%) patients had prostate or epididymis tuberculosis without associated renal lesion. CONCLUSIONS: Urogenital tuberculosis is a destructive disease of the urogenital tract with variable clinical and radiographic presentation.

Some uncommon tongue neoplasms may have characteristic radiologic features, thus permitting quite specific radiologic diagnosis. Lipomas typically manifest at both CT and MR imaging as homogeneous nonenhancing lesions. Relative to subcutaneous fat they are isoattenuating on CT images, and all MR sequences show them as isointense. Due to the paramagnetic properties of melanin, metastases from melanotic melanoma usually demonstrate high signal intensity on T1-weighted MR images and low signal intensity on T2-weighted images. Although the radiologic findings for other submucosal neoplasms are nonspecific, CT and MR imaging can play an important role in the diagnostic work-up of these unusual tumors. Delineation of the extent of the tumor, and recognition and understanding of the spectrum of imaging and the pathologic features of these lesions, often help narrow the differential diagnosis."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2036575479", "relevance_score": 181.55844, "publication_year": 2010, "title": "Augmenting the Impact of Technology Adoption With Financial Incentive to Improve Radiology Report Signature Times", "cited_by_count": 31, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Psychological intervention", "level": 2, "score": 0.66966844}, {"display_name": "Incentive", "level": 2, "score": 0.6660574}, {"display_name": "Percentile", "level": 2, "score": 0.599593}, {"display_name": "Turnaround time", "level": 2, "score": 0.5219411}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.39721572}, {"display_name": "Emergency medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.3453987}, {"display_name": "Operations management", "level": 1, "score": 0.28700298}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Radiology": [0], "report": [1, 12, 124], "signature": [2, 96], "time": [3, 17, 141], "(ST)": [4], "can": [5, 22, 42, 233], "be": [6, 43], "a": [7, 52, 82, 101, 115, 129, 195, 247], "substantial": [8], "component": [9], "of": [10, 29, 85, 161, 194, 224, 246], "total": [11], "turnaround": [13, 16], "time.": [14], "Poor": [15], "resulting": [18], "from": [19, 171, 182], "lengthy": [20], "ST": [21, 40, 138, 170, 181, 201, 216], "adversely": [23], "affect": [24], "patient": [25], "care.": [26], "The": [27, 68, 210, 244], "combination": [28], "technology": [30, 258], "adoption": [31, 163], "with": [32, 230], "financial": [33, 131, 196, 231, 248], "incentive": [34, 132, 197, 232, 249], "was": [35, 49, 142], "evaluated": [36], "to": [37, 133, 157, 173, 184, 186, 202, 204, 251], "determine": [38], "if": [39], "improvement": [41, 239], "augmented": [44], "and": [45, 74, 88, 118, 127, 145, 150, 179, 214, 237], "sustained.This": [46], "prospective": [47], "study": [48, 83, 226], "performed": [50], "at": [51], "751-bed,": [53], "urban,": [54], "tertiary": [55], "care": [56], "adult": [57], "teaching": [58], "hospital.": [59], "Test-site": [60], "imaging": [61], "volume": [62], "approximated": [63], "48,000": [64], "examinations": [65], "per": [66], "month.": [67], "radiology": [69], "department": [70], "has": [71], "100": [72], "trainees": [73], "124": [75], "attending": [76], "radiologists": [77, 107, 135], "serving": [78], "multiple": [79], "institutions.": [80], "Over": [81], "period": [84], "4": [86, 89, 203], "years": [87], "months,": [90], "three": [91], "interventions": [92, 228], "focused": [93], "on": [94], "radiologist": [95, 241], "performance": [97, 253], "were": [98, 110, 155, 217], "implemented:": [99], "1)": [100], "notification": [102], "paging": [103], "application": [104], "that": [105, 255], "alerted": [106], "when": [108], "reports": [109], "ready": [111], "for": [112, 137], "signature,": [113], "2)": [114], "picture": [116], "archiving": [117], "communications": [119], "systems": [120], "(PACS)-integrated": [121], "speech": [122, 166], "recognition": [123], "generation": [125], "system,": [126], "3)": [128], "departmental": [130], "reward": [134], "semiannually": [136], "performance.": [139], "Signature": [140], "compared": [143], "before": [144], "after": [146], "the": [147, 159, 220, 225], "interventions.": [148], "Wilcoxon": [149], "linear": [151], "regression": [152], "statistical": [153], "analyses": [154], "used": [156], "assess": [158], "significance": [160], "trends.Technology": [162], "(paging": [164], "plus": [165], "recognition)": [167], "reduced": [168], "median": [169, 213], ">5": [172], "<1": [174], "hour": [175], "(P": [176, 189, 207], "<": [177, 190, 208], ".001)": [178], "80th-percentile": [180, 200, 215], ">24": [183], "15": [185], "18": [187], "hours": [188, 206], ".001).": [191, 209], "Subsequent": [192], "addition": [193, 245], "further": [198], "improved": [199], "8": [205], "gains": [211], "in": [212, 235, 240], "sustained": [218], "over": [219], "final": [221], "31": [222], "months": [223], "period.Technology": [227], "coupled": [229], "result": [234], "synergistic": [236], "sustainable": [238], "report-signing": [242], "behavior.": [243], "leads": [250], "better": [252], "than": [254], "achievable": [256], "through": [257], "alone.": [259]}, "authors": ["Katherine P.

Poor turnaround time resulting from lengthy ST can adversely affect patient care. The combination of technology adoption with financial incentive was evaluated to determine if ST improvement can be augmented and sustained.This prospective study was performed at a 751-bed, urban, tertiary care adult teaching hospital. Test-site imaging volume approximated 48,000 examinations per month. The radiology department has 100 trainees and 124 attending radiologists serving multiple institutions. Over a study period of 4 years and 4 months, three interventions focused on radiologist signature performance were implemented: 1) a notification paging application that alerted radiologists when reports were ready for signature, 2) a picture archiving and communications systems (PACS)-integrated speech recognition report generation system, and 3) a departmental financial incentive to reward radiologists semiannually for ST performance. Signature time was compared before and after the interventions. Wilcoxon and linear regression statistical analyses were used to assess the significance of trends.Technology adoption (paging plus speech recognition) reduced median ST from >5 to <1 hour (P < .001) and 80th-percentile ST from >24 to 15 to 18 hours (P < .001). Subsequent addition of a financial incentive further improved 80th-percentile ST to 4 to 8 hours (P < .001). The gains in median and 80th-percentile ST were sustained over the final 31 months of the study period.Technology interventions coupled with financial incentive can result in synergistic and sustainable improvement in radiologist report-signing behavior.

One approach is to evaluate variation in risk by genotype based on known breast carcinogens, such as ionizing radiation. Given the public health concerns associated with recent increases in medical radiation exposure, this approach may also identify potentially susceptible subpopulations. We examined interaction between 27 newly identified breast cancer risk alleles (identified within the NCI Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility and the Breast Cancer Association Consortium genome-wide association studies) and occupational and medical diagnostic radiation exposure among 859 cases and 1083 controls nested within the United States Radiologic Technologists cohort. We did not find significant variation in the radiation-related breast cancer risk for the variant in RAD51L1 (rs10483813) on 14q24.1 as we had hypothesized. In exploratory analyses, we found that the radiation-associated breast cancer risk varied significantly by linked markers in 5p12 (rs930395, rs10941679, rs2067980 and rs4415084) in the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S30 (MRPS30) gene (Pinteraction = 0.04). Chance, however, may explain these findings, and as such, these results need to be confirmed in other populations with low to moderate levels of radiation exposure. Even though a complete understanding of the way(s) in which these variants may increase breast cancer risk remains elusive, this approach may yield clues for further investigation."}, {"id":

Recent studies suggest a need for improved resident instruction in this area. We developed and evaluated an intensive national educational course (\"boot camp\") designed to provide dedicated instruction in site-specific anatomy, radiology, and contouring using a multidisciplinary (MDT) approach.The anatomy and radiology contouring (ARC) boot camp was modeled after prior single-institution pilot studies and a needs-assessment survey. The boot camp incorporated joint lectures from radiation oncologists, anatomists, radiologists, and surgeons, with hands-on contouring instruction and small group interactive seminars using cadaveric prosections and correlative axial radiographs. Outcomes were evaluated using pretesting and posttesting, including anatomy/radiology multiple-choice questions (MCQ), timed contouring sessions (evaluated relative to a gold standard using Dice similarity metrics), and qualitative questions on satisfaction and perceived effectiveness. Analyses of pretest versus posttest scores were performed using nonparametric paired testing.Twenty-nine radiation oncology residents from 10 Canadian universities participated. As part of their current training, 29%, 75%, and 21% receive anatomy, radiology, and contouring instruction, respectively. On posttest scores, the MCQ knowledge scores improved significantly (pretest mean 60% vs posttest mean 80%, P<.001). Across all contoured structures, there was a 0.20 median improvement in students' average Dice score (P<.001). For individual structures, significant Dice improvements occurred in 10 structures. Residents self-reported an improved ability to contour OARs and interpret radiographs in all anatomic sites, 92% of students found the MDT format effective for their learning, and 93% found the boot camp more effective than educational sessions at their own institutions. All of the residents (100%) would recommend this course to others.The ARC boot camp is an effective intervention for improving radiation oncology residents' knowledge and understanding of anatomy and radiology in addition to enhancing their confidence and accuracy in contouring."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2060097378", "relevance_score": 141.66759, "publication_year": 2009, "title":

Comparative studies evaluating long-term EVA clinical treatment outcomes, the optimal timing of adjunctive procedures, and the relative impact of anatomic location, size, length, and energy deposition in the treated segment are expected in the near future. This document provides recommended reporting standards for physicians performing clinical research studies evaluating EVA in the treatment of lower extremity venous reflux and is thereby expected to facilitate comparison between the results of different studies and to improve the overall quality of clinical research on venous disease. These standards have been developed by The Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) and The American Venous Forum and were approved by the SIR Executive Council on February 28, 2007, and by the AVF Executive Council on February 13, 2007.Population DescriptionThe general description of the population from which studied groups were selected should be presented. This should include the total number of patients seen and treated at participating institutions during the study period, patients' gender and age distribution, and frequencies of major treatment modalities used.For studies including patients with bilateral disease, both the number of patients and the number of treated limbs, and whether limbs were treated concomitantly or staged must be stated. Baseline patient characteristics should include the level II basic CEAP (10) classification (Table 1).Table 1CEAP Classification of Chronic Venous DiseaseClassificationSymptomClinical C0No visible or palpable signs of venous disease C1Telangiectases or reticular veins C2Varicose veins C3Edema C4aPigmentation or eczema C4bLipodermatosclerosis or atrophie blanche C5Healed venous ulcer C6Active venous ulcer SSymptomatic, including ache, pain, tightness, skin irritation, heaviness, and muscle cramps, and other complaints attributable to venous dysfunction AAsymptomaticEtiologic EcCongenital EpPrimary EsSecondary (postthrombotic) EnNo venous cause identifiedAnatomic AsSuperficial veins ApPerforator veins AdDeep veins AnNo venous location identifiedPathophysiologic PrReflux PoObstruction Pr,oReflux and obstruction PnNo venous pathophysiology identifiableLevel of investigation Level IOffice visit, with history and clinical examination, which may include the use of a hand-held Doppler scanner Level IINoninvasive vascular laboratory testing, which now routinely includes duplex color scanning, with some plethysmographic method added as desired Level IIIInvasive investigations or more complex imaging studies, including ascending and descending venography, venous pressure measurements, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imagingExampleA patient has painful swelling of the leg, and varicose veins, lipodermatosclerosis, and active ulceration.

The Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS, Table 2) is highly recommended as a measure of overall disease severity (11Rutherford R.B. Padberg Jr, F.T. Comerota A.J. Kistner R.L. Meissner M.H.

The Venous Insufficiency Epidemiologic and Economic Study of Quality-of-Life (VEINESQOL/Sym) questionnaire scale, the Chronic Venous Insufficiency Questionnaire-2 (CIVIQ-2), and the Aberdeen questionnaires have all been validated in patients with lower extremity venous reflux and are highly recommended for use as venous disease\u2013specific QOL measures (13Lamping D.L.

Common symptoms of venous disease include aching, burning, itching, heaviness, swelling, cramping, and local inflammation in the affected limb, among others.A history of superficial or deep venous disease or interventions, or both, may influence both the performance and the results of EVA procedures and is therefore important to describe. Specifically, the following interventions are important: use of graduated compression stockings; a history of venous stripping and/or ligation of truncal veins, ambulatory phlebectomy, sclerotherapy, subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery (SEPS), previous EVA procedures, thrombolysis, angioplasty, or stent placement; or the presence of endovenous devices including stents, inferior vena cava filters, and central venous access devices.The presence of major comorbidi-ties may reduce the clinical success rate or increase the rate of complications, or both. Conversely, exclusion of patient subsets due to morbidity can also bias the population and should be considered when comparing patient cohorts. The following comorbidities may influence the results of EVA and should be reported: coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, thrombophilias, increased body mass index, and poor overall general health (20Merchant R.F. Pichot O. Long term outcomes of endovenous radiofrequency ablation of saphenous reflux as a treatment for superficial venous insufficiency.J Vasc Surg. 2005; 42: 502-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar).Additional Anatomic and Physiologic Characterization of Venous DiseasePotential candidates for EVA include patients with reflux in an incompetent GSV or small saphenous vein (SSV) or in a major tributary branch of the GSV or SSV such as the anterior thigh circumflex vein, posterior thigh circumflex vein, or anterior accessory GSV. Therefore, the presence of reflux in these veins is important to document using duplex ultrasound imaging, as pertaining to the CEAP A5 nonsaphenous category. Use of the nomenclature recommended by the International Union of Phlebology, the International Federation of Associations of Anatomists, and the Federative International Committee on Anatomical Terminology is expected (21Caggiati A. Bergan J.J. Gloviczki P. Jantet G. Wendell-Smith C.P. Partsch H.

These include tortuosity of the target vein, duplications, atresia, the presence of anatomic venous variants, or variable termination of the SSV. The diameter of the GSV and SSV, \u22642 cm of the junction with the deep vein (common femoral or popliteal) and target vein (if not the GSV or SSV) should be measured. The patient position and site of treatment should be specified.Although a combination of a directed physical examination and duplex ultrasound imaging (CEAP level II examination) is usually sufficient to characterize the anatomic and physiologic extent of lower extremity venous disease (23Min R.J. Khilnani N.M. Golia P. Duplex ultrasound evaluation of lower extremity venous insufficiency.J Vasc Interv Radiol. 2003; 14: 1233-1241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), diagnosis of chronic venous disorders can also be supported by direct or indirect physiologic tests (24Porter J.M. Rutherford R.B. Clagett G.P. Cranley J.J. O'Donnell T.F. Raju S. et al.Reporting standards in venous disease.J Vasc Surg. 1988; 8: 172-181PubMed Google Scholar, 25Nicolaides A.N. Investigation of chronic venous insufficiency: a consensus statement.Circulation. 2004; 102: E126-E163Crossref Google Scholar). When these tests are obtained, the results should be reported. Similarly, when a CEAP level III examination is performed using computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, the reason for their use should be specified, the results should be reported, and the specific criteria used for diagnosis of venous abnormalities should be indicated.Terminology and DefinitionsDefinitions of clinical signs and symptoms should comply with definitions presented in the revised CEAP classification (10Eklof B. Rutherford R.B. Bergan J.J. Carpentier P.H. Gloviczki P. Kistner R.L. et al.American Venous Forum International Ad Hoc Committee for Revision of the CEAP ClassificationRevision of the CEAP classification for chronic venous disorders: consensus statement.J Vasc Surg. 2004; 40: 1248-1252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar).Use of the nomenclature recommended by the International Union of Phlebology, the International Federation of Associations of Anato-mists, and the Federative International Committee on Anatomical Terminology is expected (21Caggiati A.

Specific recommendations include the terms great saphenous vein or GSV (instead of long saphenous vein, greater saphenous vein, or internal saphenous vein) and small saphenous vein or SSV (instead of short saphenous vein, lesser saphenous vein, or external saphenous vein).The ultrasound criteria used to define reflux should be indicated; in current practice, most vascular laboratories consider the presence of venous flow reversal for >0.5 to 1.0 seconds with proximal compression, Valsalva maneuver, or distal compression and release to represent pathologic reflux (23Min R.J. Khilnani N.M. Golia P.

Bedford G. Beach K. Strandness D.E. Quantitative segmental evaluation of venous valvular reflux with DUS ultrasound scanning.J Vasc Surg. 1989; 10: 425-431PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar).Treatment DescriptionPretreatment PreparationThe aspects of pretreatment preparation that may influence EVA treatment outcomes are important to describe. This includes methods used to increase the distension of the lower extremity veins, such as pretreatment ambulation, patient positioning maneuvers, temperature adjustments to the procedure room, use of tourniquets, or pharmacologic maneuvers such as the administration of vasodilators. The method of marking and mapping the target vein(s) are also important to indicate.Method of Vein Access, Intraprocedural Imaging, and AnesthesiaThe method of venous entry\u2014percutaneous, surgical cutdown, or venotomy\u2014should be stated. Imaging guidance for venous access, administration of anesthetic injections, and monitoring of other aspects of the procedure that is provided by ultrasound guidance, fluoroscopic guidance, or a combination should be reported. The type of access system (eg, micropuncture system vs larger needle) is important to report. The precise location of the percutaneous access site(s) is important to indicate as well as the reason for selection of this point (eg, absence of reflux, potential access difficulties below a certain point, and multiple large tributaries). Tumescent anesthesia is usually administered using a dilute local anesthetic to provide local anesthesia, protect surrounding tissues (including adjacent nerves and overlying skin) from the thermal injury, and mechanically collapse the vein to decrease the distance between the catheter-based heat source and the vein walls and thereby enable nonthrombotic ablation of the vein (3Min R.J. Khilnani N. Zimmet S.E. endovenous laser treatment of saphenous vein reflux: long term results.J Vasc Interv Radiol. 2003; 14: 991-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). The concentration, volume, and method of administration (ie, hand-injection or mechanical device) of local anesthetic drugs should therefore be described. The use of fluoroscopy or venography must be reported.Method of Endovenous AblationFor thermal ablation techniques, the type of energy (endovenous laser or radiofrequency) along with the manufacturer of the device should be reported. The energy level (power in watts), time of energy deployment (seconds), mode of delivery (pulsed or continuous mode), and total amount of energy emitted must be reported. If a pulsed mode is used during endovenous laser ablation, the duration and frequency of the pulse should be noted.For radiofrequency, temperature of the catheter\u2013vein interface, size of the catheter (6F, 8F), catheter and generator model, rate of catheter pull-back in cm/min, and total treatment time should be reported.For chemical ablation techniques, the concentration, type of sclerosant (including manufacturer), and volume of the sclerosing agent must be reported. If a foam solution is used, the foaming technique should be recorded.The starting point, ending point, and total length of the ablated segment should be reported in a quantitative fashion (eg, from 1 cm below the saphenofemoral junction to 1 cm above the puncture site; total, 40 cm), and for GSV ablation in relation to groin tributaries (ie, below epigastric vein).The type and timing of postprocedure care such as compression therapy should also be reported. The class and type of compression therapy and activity restrictions should be reported.Adjunctive ProceduresAdjunctive procedures such as sclerotherapy and stab phlebectomies are commonly used in patients undergoing EVA. Because of their influence on treatment outcomes, the use and timing of any adjunctive procedures used at the time of EVA or before the initial outcomes assessment should be described. Administration of sclerosant solution through the vascular sheath encasing the laser or radiofrequency probe should be reported. The type of sclerosant, concentration, volume, and foaming technique for foam sclero-therapy should be noted. It should also be clear whether adjunctive procedures were intended as part of the initial treatment approach.Outcomes AssessmentClinical research studies on EVA may be generally categorized into two types: clinical outcome studies and technology assessment studies.Clinical Outcomes StudiesThese studies are designed to assess the clinical efficacy and to verify the safety of EVA procedures and are expected to quantify the impact of therapy on clinical outcomes that are meaningful to patients, such as:1relief of presenting symptoms,2frequency of skin ulcer healing and time to recurrence,3prevention of progression of chronic venous insufficiency,4improvement in quality of life, and5improvement in cosmesis, or a combination of these.EVA may succeed in achieving all, some, or none of these goals; similarly, EVA may alleviate all, some, or none of the presenting symptoms. It is therefore important for authors to define the primary clinical intent of the procedure and to adjudicate success or failure by this criterion. The primary clinical intent must be a clinical outcome of importance to patients (eg, relief of the dominant presenting symptom) rather than an anatomic/ imaging outcome (eg, ultrasound-proven occlusion of the target vein). Other end points of interest may also be reported, such as the continued need for compression stockings and anti-inflammatory medications after EVA and the need for additional endovenous or surgical procedures.Because causation of clinical outcomes is generally implied as related to treatment, anatomic and imaging outcome at the same follow-up points must be reported.Technology Assessment StudiesThese studies are designed to answer specific technical questions about a new treatment modality before embarking on full-scale clinical outcomes studies. For such studies, it is acceptable to report an anatomic or imaging outcome (eg, successful ultrasound-proven ablation of the target vein) as the primary outcome, but the authors must limit their conclusions accordingly and no mention of clinical efficacy may be made unless a clinical outcome was systematically evaluated. Because the specific goals of therapy will vary among patients, investigators should report outcomes in as many of the following relevant categories as possible.Assessment of Treatment EffectivenessSymptom ReliefA number of methods may be used to report treatment success in relieving presenting symptoms. In general, the use of validated patient-reported measures of venous symptom status is preferred over \u201chomemade\u201d scales or other subjective assessments. Authors may choose to use disease-specific validated scales designed to provide an assessment of venous symptoms (eg, VEINES-Sym, Aberdeen Varicose Vein Score, and the Charing Cross Venous Ulcer Score). Authors may also focus on objectively documenting improvement in one or more specific symptoms; for example, validated pain scales such as a Likert scale may be used to assess lower extremity pain, although pain and discomfort are routinely addressed in the above QOL measures. Such assessments may be supplemented by objective measures of clinical improvement that are based upon physician assessment of clinical signs (eg, measurement of leg circumferences in standardized fashion for assessment of lower extremity swelling), but determination of treatment success should not rely exclusively on physician assessments because they may or may not correlate with clinical improvement, which is meaningful to patients.Assessment of Treatment EffectivenessDisease Severity and Quality of LifePresenting symptoms and QOL may improve rapidly after EVA, but meaningful evaluation of the progression of chronic venous insufficiency needs a significantly longer time. Clinical follow-up should therefore be graded as short-term (<1 year), mid-term (1 to 3 years), or long-term (>3 years).Although the CEAP system is a useful descriptive tool, it is thought to have too many static elements to be effective in monitoring change in disease status with treatment (27Vedantham S. Grassi C.J. Ferral H. Patel N.H. Thorpe P.E. Antonacci V.P. et al.Technology Assessment Committee of the Society of Interventional RadiologyReporting standards for endovascular treatment of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis.J Vasc Interv Radiol. 2006; 17: 417-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For this reason, a number of alternative scoring systems have been developed and partially validated for assessment of venous disease severity in patients with chronic venous insufficiency. The American Venous Forum has recommended use of the VCSS to quantify the clinical severity of venous disease (Table 2). The VCSS is based on physician assessment of the presence and severity of nine common stigmata of chronic venous disease and the use of compression stockings. VCSS scores correlate well with CEAP clinical class and with the presence of abnormalities in the venous system documented with ultrasound imaging (28Rutherford R.B. Padberg F.T. Comerota A.J.

For studies that focus primarily on patients with venous ulcers, there also exist measures targeted to this subgroup (15Smith J.J. Guest M. Greenhalgh R.M. Davies A.H.

When QOL is assessed, a generic QOL measure, such as the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (SF-36) measure, and a venous disease\u2013specific QOL measure should be used. In recent years, a number of venous disease\u2013 specific QOL measures have been developed and at least partly validated; three are listed here:\u2022The VEINES-QOL/Sym consists of 26 question items that measure venous symptoms, limitations in daily activities due to venous disease, psychologic impact of venous disease, and change over time. The VEINES-QOL/Sym has undergone comprehensive and rigorous psychometric evaluation and is acceptable, reliable, valid, and responsive for use as a patient-reported measure of outcome in chronic venous disease (11Rutherford R.B.

In most cases, an understanding of the histologic classification and staging is essential to design the imaging workup for the patient. Precise staging is critical, particularly for patients with HD and extranodal NHL. The malignant lymphomas share many similar radiographic features, yet have notable differences. An understanding of the pattern of extension of HD is useful in choosing an imaging modality for both staging and follow-up. Contiguous extension of HD follows lymphatic channels and is primarily limited to nodal compartments in the mediastinum and retroperitoneal lymph nodes. On the other hand, NHL may be either widespread or extranodal and localized. In the first instance, the histology will be low grade; in the second, intermediate or high grade. An understanding of these histologic clues is critical to the structuring of an efficient staging workup for the patient with NHL. Posttreatment follow-up imaging strategies should be governed by the fact that in both HD and NHL, recurrences are usually apparent within two years following initial treatment.

Natural language processing (NLP) methods may help extract this information, but these methods have rarely been applied outside the research laboratories where they were developed. Objective To implement and validate NLP tools to identify long bone fractures for pediatric emergency medicine quality improvement. Methods Using freely available statistical software packages, we implemented NLP methods to identify long bone fractures from radiology reports. A sample of 1,000 radiology reports was used to construct three candidate classification models. A test set of 500 reports was used to validate the model performance. Blinded manual review of radiology reports by two independent physicians provided the reference standard. Each radiology report was segmented and word stem and bigram features were constructed. Common English \u201cstop words\u201d and rare features were excluded. We used 10-fold cross-validation to select optimal configuration parameters for each model. Accuracy, recall, precision and the F1 score were calculated. The final model was compared to the use of diagnosis codes for the identification of patients with long bone fractures. Results There were 329 unique word stems and 344 bigrams in the training documents. A support vector machine classifier with Gaussian kernel performed best on the test set with accuracy=0.958, recall=0.969, precision=0.940, and F1 score=0.954. Optimal parameters for this model were cost=4 and gamma=0.005. The three classification models that we tested all performed better than diagnosis codes in terms of accuracy, precision, and F1 score (diagnosis code accuracy=0.932, recall=0.960, precision=0.896, and F1 score=0.927). Conclusions NLP methods using a corpus of 1,000 training documents accurately identified acute long bone fractures from radiology reports. Strategic use of straightforward NLP methods, implemented with freely available software, offers quality improvement teams new opportunities to extract information from narrative documents.

The Royal College of Radiologists has published advice on how to conduct meetings, suggesting that discrepancies are scored using the scale: 0=no error, 1=minor error, 2=moderate error and 3=major error. We have noticed variation in scores attributed to individual cases by radiologists and have sought to quantify the variation in scoring at our meetings. Methods: The scores from six discrepancy meetings totalling 161 scored events were collected. The reliability of scoring was measured using Fleiss' kappa, which calculates the degree of agreement in classification. Results: The number of cases rated at the six meetings ranged from 18 to 31 (mean 27). The number of raters ranged from 11 to 16 (mean 14). Only cases where all the raters scored were included in the analysis. The Fleiss' kappa statistic ranged from 0.12 to 0.20, and mean kappa was 0.17 for the six meetings. Conclusion: A kappa of 1.0 indicates perfect agreement above chance and 0.0 indicates agreement equal to chance. A rule of thumb is that a kappa \u22650.70 indicates adequate interrater agreement. Our mean result of 0.172 shows poor agreement between scorers. This could indicate a problem with the scoring system or may indicate a need for more formal training and agreement in how scores are applied.

The tumours occurred in seven males and four females with a mean age of 59.1 years (range 27-87 years). Their ultrasound features were categorized according to Bosniak [5]. There were six category 3 or 4 cysts (indeterminate or malignant); three category 2 cysts and two category 1 cysts. Computed tomography scans (CT) demonstrated malignant features in all seven patients scanned. Cyst aspiration, intravenous urograms and arteriograms were generally unhelpful. Histological growth patterns of nine tumours were determined and all were staged by Robson's classification: eight were Stage 1, one was Stage 3 and two were Stage 4. Three of four deaths were related to tumour bulk, and the fourth patient died from an unrelated cause. All seven survivors had Stage 1 disease. No correlation existed between different histological subtypes and tumour aggression. Overall, the behaviour of cystic RCCs was similar to those of solid RCCs apart from the high percentage (72.2%) of Stage 1 disease. We conclude that any deviation from a simple cyst on ultrasound should be assessed by CT and/or surgery.

frequency of errors during vascular interventional radiology (VIR) and design and implement an intervention to reduce error and improve efficiency in this setting. Materials and Methods Ethical guidance was sought from the Research Services Department at Imperial College London. Informed consent was not obtained. Field notes were recorded during 55 VIR procedures by a single observer. Two blinded assessors identified failures from field notes and categorized them into one or more errors by using a 22-part classification system. The potential to cause harm, disruption to procedural flow, and preventability of each failure was determined. A preprocedural team rehearsal (PPTR) was then designed and implemented to target frequent preventable potential failures. Thirty-three procedures were observed subsequently to determine the efficacy of the PPTR. Nonparametric statistical analysis was used to determine the effect of intervention on potential failure rates, potential to cause harm and procedural flow disruption scores (Mann-Whitney U test), and number of preventable failures (Fisher exact test). Results Before intervention, 1197 potential failures were recorded, of which 54.6% were preventable. A total of 2040 errors were deemed to have occurred to produce these failures. Planning error (19.7%), staff absence (16.2%), equipment unavailability (12.2%), communication error (11.2%), and lack of safety consciousness (6.1%) were the most frequent errors, accounting for 65.4% of the total. After intervention, 352 potential failures were recorded. Classification resulted in 477 errors. Preventable failures decreased from 54.6% to 27.3% (P < .001) with implementation of PPTR. Potential failure rates per hour decreased from 18.8 to 9.2 (P < .001), with no increase in potential to cause harm or procedural flow disruption per failure. Conclusion Failures during VIR procedures are largely because of ineffective planning, communication error, and equipment difficulties, rather than a result of technical or patient-related issues. Many of these potential failures are preventable. A PPTR is an effective means of targeting frequent preventable failures, reducing procedural delays and improving patient safety. \u00a9 RSNA, 2012"}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2155736595", "relevance_score": 199.54645, "publication_year": 2015, "title": "The Importance of Human\u2013Computer Interaction in Radiology E-learning", "cited_by_count": 30, "concepts": [{"display_name": "PsycINFO", "level": 3, "score": 0.6512225}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.53054863}, {"display_name": "Radiological weapon", "level": 2, "score": 0.49978495}, {"display_name": "MEDLINE", "level": 2, "score": 0.41705677}, {"display_name": "Medical education", "level": 1, "score": 0.34134254}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"With": [0], "the": [1, 30, 34, 84, 165, 169, 188, 207], "development": [2], "of": [3, 12, 29, 36, 48, 56, 86, 168, 180, 190, 209], "cross-sectional": [4], "imaging": [5], "techniques": [6], "and": [7, 44, 54, 59, 69, 79, 125, 137, 148, 163, 178, 201, 212, 222], "transformation": [8], "to": [9, 114, 119, 126, 144, 157, 226], "digital": [10], "reading": [11], "radiological": [13, 87, 146, 199], "imaging,": [14], "e-learning": [15, 42, 50, 88, 101, 109, 134, 154, 192, 210], "might": [16], "be": [17, 115, 127, 224], "a": [18, 116], "promising": [19], "tool": [20], "in": [21, 40, 64, 193], "undergraduate": [22, 91, 194], "radiology": [23, 41, 49, 181, 191], "education.": [24], "In": [25, 150, 186], "this": [26], "systematic": [27, 62], "review": [28], "literature,": [31], "we": [32], "evaluate": [33], "emergence": [35], "image": [37, 104, 111, 139, 160, 202, 214], "interaction": [38, 105, 112, 140], "possibilities": [39, 113, 141, 216], "programs": [43, 102, 135, 155], "evidence": [45], "for": [46, 90, 129], "effects": [47], "on": [51, 217], "learning": [52, 120, 130, 218], "outcomes": [53, 219], "perspectives": [55], "medical": [57, 92, 195], "students": [58, 152], "teachers.": [60], "A": [61], "search": [63], "PubMed,": [65], "EMBASE,": [66], "Cochrane,": [67], "ERIC,": [68], "PsycInfo": [70], "was": [71], "performed.": [72], "Articles": [73], "were": [74, 96, 142], "screened": [75], "by": [76, 183], "two": [77], "authors": [78], "included": [80], "when": [81], "they": [82, 173], "concerned": [83], "evaluation": [85], "tools": [89], "students.": [93], "Nineteen": [94], "articles": [95], "included.": [97], "Seven": [98], "studies": [99], "evaluated": [100], "with": [103, 110, 121, 136, 211], "possibilities.": [106], "Students": [107], "perceived": [108], "useful": [117], "addition": [118, 189], "hard": [122], "copy": [123], "images": [124], "effective": [128], "3D": [131], "anatomy.": [132], "Both": [133], "without": [138, 213], "found": [143, 153, 164], "improve": [145, 198], "knowledge": [147, 177, 200], "skills.": [149, 204], "general,": [151], "easy": [156], "use,": [158], "rated": [159], "quality": [161], "high,": [162], "difficulty": [166], "level": [167], "courses": [170], "appropriate.": [171], "Furthermore,": [172], "felt": [174], "that": [175], "their": [176], "understanding": [179], "improved": [182], "using": [184], "e-learning.": [185], "conclusion,": [187], "education": [196], "can": [197], "interpretation": [203, 215], "Differences": [205], "between": [206], "effect": [208], "are": [220], "unknown": [221], "should": [223], "subject": [225], "future": [227], "research.": [228]}, "authors": ["Annemarie M. den Harder", "Marissa Frijlingh", "C\u00e9cile J.

In this systematic review of the literature, we evaluate the emergence of image interaction possibilities in radiology e-learning programs and evidence for effects of radiology e-learning on learning outcomes and perspectives of medical students and teachers. A systematic search in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, ERIC, and PsycInfo was performed. Articles were screened by two authors and included when they concerned the evaluation of radiological e-learning tools for undergraduate medical students. Nineteen articles were included. Seven studies evaluated e-learning programs with image interaction possibilities. Students perceived e-learning with image interaction possibilities to be a useful addition to learning with hard copy images and to be effective for learning 3D anatomy. Both e-learning programs with and without image interaction possibilities were found to improve radiological knowledge and skills. In general, students found e-learning programs easy to use, rated image quality high, and found the difficulty level of the courses appropriate.

Evaluate the implementation of a structured report (SR) in a university hospital. A model of a structured report for thyroid sonography was developed according to information gathered from radiologists and endocrinologists working in this field. The report was based on a web platform and installed as a part of a Radiological Information System (RIS) and a Hospital Information System (HIS). The time for the report generation under the two forms was evaluated over a four-month period, two months for each method. After this period, radiologists and requiring physicians were questioned about the two methods of reporting. For free text, 98 sonograms were reported to have thyroids with nodules in an average time of 8.71 (+/\u22124.11) minutes, and 59 sonograms of thyroids without nodules were reported in an average time of 4.54 (+/\u2212 3.97) minutes. For SR, 73 sonograms in an average time of 6.08 (+/\u22123.8) minutes for thyroids with nodules and 3.67 (+/\u22122.51) minutes for thyroids without nodules. Most of the radiologists (76.2%) preferred the SR, as originally created or with suggested changes. Among endocrinologists, 80% preferred the SR. From the requiring physicians\u2019 perspective, the SR enabled standardization and improved information transmission. This information is valuable because physicians need reports prepared by radiologists. The implementation of a SR in a university hospital, under an RIS/HIS system, was viable.

As one of the primary diagnostic tools for detecting liver cancer, dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography provides detailed evidences for diagnosis that are recorded in free-text radiology reports. Objective The aim of our study was to apply a deep learning model and rule-based natural language processing (NLP) method to identify evidences for liver cancer diagnosis automatically. Methods We proposed a pretrained, fine-tuned BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)-based BiLSTM-CRF (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory-Conditional Random Field) model to recognize the phrases of APHE (hyperintense enhancement in the arterial phase) and PDPH (hypointense in the portal and delayed phases). To identify more essential diagnostic evidences, we used the traditional rule-based NLP methods for the extraction of radiological features. APHE, PDPH, and other extracted radiological features were used to design a computer-aided liver cancer diagnosis framework by random forest. Results The BERT-BiLSTM-CRF predicted the phrases of APHE and PDPH with an F1 score of 98.40% and 90.67%, respectively. The prediction model using combined features had a higher performance (F1 score, 88.55%) than those using APHE and PDPH (84.88%) or other extracted radiological features (83.52%). APHE and PDPH were the top 2 essential features for liver cancer diagnosis. Conclusions This work was a comprehensive NLP study, wherein we identified evidences for the diagnosis of liver cancer from Chinese radiology reports, considering both clinical knowledge and radiology findings. The BERT-based deep learning method for the extraction of diagnostic evidence achieved state-of-the-art performance. The high performance proves the feasibility of the BERT-BiLSTM-CRF model in information extraction from Chinese radiology reports. The findings of our study suggest that the deep learning\u2013based method for automatically identifying evidences for diagnosis can be extended to other types of Chinese clinical texts."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2040063346", "relevance_score": 157.54874, "publication_year": 1954, "title": "The radiological manifestations of pulmonary hypertension in patients with mitral stenosis", "cited_by_count": 30, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Pulmonary hypertension", "level": 2, "score": 0.8488977}, {"display_name": "Pulmonary artery", "level": 2, "score": 0.770632}, {"display_name": "Cardiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.739852}, {"display_name": "Internal medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.6532166}, {"display_name": "Pulmonary wedge pressure", "level": 3, "score": 0.45415938}, {"display_name": "Stenosis", "level": 2, "score": 0.44648528}, {"display_name": "Lung", "level": 2, "score": 0.43157625}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.34848318}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Summary": [0], "A": [1], "radiological": [2, 67], "assessment": [3], "has": [4], "been": [5], "made": [6], "of": [7, 21, 57, 74, 114, 127, 133, 139, 147, 155, 164, 170, 174, 182, 188, 198, 202, 209, 226, 256, 264, 302, 317, 331, 334], "the": [8, 11, 14, 18, 22, 25, 28, 35, 46, 59, 72, 125, 131, 156, 175, 199, 203, 207, 224, 314], "heart": [9, 138], "size,": [10], "\u2018pulmonary": [12, 157], "conus\u2019,": [13], "main": [15, 19, 176, 200], "pulmonary": [16, 23, 48, 60, 75, 86, 134, 144, 165, 177, 183, 204, 210, 230, 246, 257, 281, 293, 306, 323, 335], "artery,": [17], "branches": [20, 201], "arteries,": [24], "perihilar": [26, 213], "vessels,": [27, 30], "peripheral": [29, 268], "and": [31, 54, 107, 130, 206, 219, 244, 259, 279, 321, 325], "horizontal": [32], "lines": [33, 309], "in": [34, 38, 44, 55, 82, 96, 109, 217, 221, 223, 239, 273, 275, 289, 313], "lung": [36, 315], "fields": [37, 316], "25": [39], "patients": [40, 84, 98, 111, 227, 241, 276, 290, 318], "with": [41, 71, 85, 99, 112, 228, 242, 277, 291, 319], "mitral": [42], "stenosis": [43], "whom": [45, 58], "resting": [47], "artery": [49, 87, 178], "mean": [50, 88], "blood-pressures": [51, 62, 89], "were": [52, 63, 69, 215, 236, 270, 310], "known": [53], "15": [56], "capillary": [61], "also": [64, 237], "known.": [65], "The": [66, 212, 267], "signs": [68], "correlated": [70], "degree": [73, 126, 132, 208, 333], "hypertension,": [76, 135, 231, 282, 294], "which": [77], "was": [78, 286], "arbitrarily": [79], "considered": [80], "mild": [81, 152, 245, 292], "7": [83], "less": [90], "than": [91, 150], "40": [92, 102], "mm.": [93, 105, 116], "Hg,": [94, 106], "moderate": [95, 243, 278, 303, 320], "10": [97], "pressures": [100, 113], "from": [101], "to": [103, 327], "69": [104], "severe": [108, 229, 280, 305, 322], "8": [110], "70": [115], "Hg": [117], "or": [118, 167, 304], "over.": [119], "There": [120, 191], "is": [121, 146, 159, 179, 192, 299], "no": [122, 148, 186], "relation": [123], "between": [124, 196], "cardiac": [128], "enlargement": [129, 197], "but": [136, 185, 232], "a": [137, 151, 161, 180, 193, 254, 300, 329], "normal": [140], "size": [141], "suggests": [142], "that": [143, 296], "hypertension": [145, 166, 184, 247, 258, 324], "more": [149], "degree.": [153, 172, 190, 266], "Enlargement": [154, 173], "conus\u2019": [158], "not": [160, 260], "reliable": [162], "sign": [163, 181, 255, 301, 330], "an": [168, 262], "index": [169, 187, 263], "its": [171, 189, 265], "rough": [194], "correlation": [195], "arteries": [205], "hypertension.": [211, 307, 336], "vessels": [214, 269], "enlarged": [216], "calibre": [218], "increased": [220, 272], "number": [222, 274], "majority": [225], "as": [233, 253, 261], "these": [234, 332], "changes": [235], "present": [238, 312], "some": [240], "they": [248], "must": [249], "be": [250, 328], "regarded": [251], "only": [252], "frequently": [271, 311], "whilst": [283], "this": [284, 297], "abnormality": [285], "rarely": [287], "seen": [288], "indicating": [295], "change": [298], "Horizontal": [308], "appear": [326]}, "authors": ["William Whitaker", "Thomas E.

The radiological signs were correlated with the degree of pulmonary hypertension, which was arbitrarily considered mild in 7 patients with pulmonary artery mean blood-pressures less than 40 mm. Hg, moderate in 10 patients with pressures from 40 to 69 mm. Hg, and severe in 8 patients with pressures of 70 mm. Hg or over. There is no relation between the degree of cardiac enlargement and the degree of pulmonary hypertension, but a heart of normal size suggests that pulmonary hypertension is of no more than a mild degree. Enlargement of the \u2018pulmonary conus\u2019 is not a reliable sign of pulmonary hypertension or an index of its degree. Enlargement of the main pulmonary artery is a sign of pulmonary hypertension but no index of its degree. There is a rough correlation between enlargement of the main branches of the pulmonary arteries and the degree of pulmonary hypertension. The perihilar vessels were enlarged in calibre and increased in number in the majority of patients with severe pulmonary hypertension, but as these changes were also present in some patients with moderate and mild pulmonary hypertension they must be regarded only as a sign of pulmonary hypertension and not as an index of its degree. The peripheral vessels were frequently increased in number in patients with moderate and severe pulmonary hypertension, whilst this abnormality was rarely seen in patients with mild pulmonary hypertension, indicating that this change is a sign of moderate or severe pulmonary hypertension. Horizontal lines were frequently present in the lung fields of patients with moderate and severe pulmonary hypertension and appear to be a sign of these degree of pulmonary hypertension."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W1595650076", "relevance_score": 307.59454, "publication_year": 1999, "title": "Applied Radiological Anatomy", "cited_by_count": 29, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Information retrieval", "level": 1, "score": 0.35391456}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Book": [0, 4, 10, 15], "summary": [1, 5, 11, 16], "page": [2, 6, 12], "views": [3, 7, 13, 17], "help": [8, 14], "Close": [9], "reflect": [18], "the": [19, 24], "number": [20], "of": [21], "visits": [22], "to": [23], "book": [25], "and": [26], "chapter": [27], "landing": [28], "pages.": [29], "Total": [30], "views:": [31], "0": [32], "*": [33], "Loading": [34], "metrics...": [35]}, "authors": ["Paul Butler", "Adam Mitchell", "Harold Ellis"], "abstract": "Book summary page views Book summary page views help Close Book summary page views help Book summary views reflect the number of visits to the book and chapter landing pages.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the interob-server reliability and intraobserver reproducibility of Letournel, Sanders, and Zwipp classification systems on CT scan and the B\u00f6hler's angle measurement on plain X-ray. Furthermore, we studied if the addition of a CT scan to the plain X-ray influenced the evaluation of fracture extension to the calcaneocuboid joint. Methods: The CT scan and plain X-ray images of 51 intra-articular calcaneal fractures were evaluated two times by three observers (two radiologists and one orthopedic surgeon) within a 5-month interval. The interobserver reliability was measured using the Fleiss kappa while the intraobserver reproducibility was measured using the Cohen's kappa. Results: The mean kappa values for the interobserver reliability and intraobserver reproducibility of the Sanders classification were 0.25 and 0.39, respectively, of Zwipp classification were 0.24 and 0.16, respectively, while those of the Letournel classification were 0.50 and 0.42, respectively. For the B\u00f6hler's angle, the mean kappa values for the interobserver reliability and intraobserver reproducibility were 0.34 and 0.32, respectively. The addition of CT scan images to plain X-ray found a higher incidence of calcaneocuboid joint involvement. Conclusion: Clinicians should be aware of the limitation regarding the interobserver reliability and intraobserver reproducibility of the Letournel, Sanders and Zwipp classification systems for calcaneal fractures.

To sustain such wide-ranging growth and yet remain intact as a medical specialty, the profession will require many radiologists who can provide leadership to bridge the many gaps between the various frontiers and the traditional core of radiology. These radiologists will need skills and background in two critical management areas: leadership and strategy. This article approaches the broad topic of strategy in several ways. First, it provides the radiologist with a basic framework for strategy development. Second, it summarizes central ideas from the evolving field of strategic thinking. Finally, it outlines a strategy-based method for dealing with uncertainty about the future and identifies situations where specific strategic tools and techniques are likely to be helpful. \u00a9 RSNA, 2002"}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2017996434", "relevance_score": 231.36128, "publication_year": 1998, "title": "Clinical radiological issues in orthodontic practice", "cited_by_count": 29, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Radiological weapon", "level": 2, "score": 0.92990756}, {"display_name": "Medical physics", "level": 1, "score": 0.37242138}, {"display_name": "Dentistry", "level": 1, "score": 0.32743305}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.21816894}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Radiology": [0], "has": [1], "long": [2], "played": [3], "a": [4, 29], "critical": [5], "role": [6], "in": [7, 80], "the": [8, 25, 48, 53, 58, 61, 81], "treatment": [9], "planning": [10], "of": [11, 16, 32, 52], "theorthodontic": [12], "patient.": [13], "The": [14, 45], "focus": [15], "this": [17], "article": [18, 46], "is": [19], "on": [20], "common": [21, 56], "issues": [22], "that": [23, 75], "confront": [24], "orthodontist": [26], "and": [27, 35, 50, 60], "how": [28], "basic": [30], "understanding": [31], "radiological": [33, 37], "techniques": [34], "simple": [36], "procedures": [38], "can": [39, 76], "be": [40, 78], "used": [41], "to": [42, 71, 84], "resolve": [43], "them.": [44], "addresses": [47], "advantages": [49], "shortcomings": [51], "two": [54], "most": [55], "films,": [57], "cephalogram": [59], "panoramic": [62], "view,": [63], "taken": [64, 79], "by": [65], "orthodontists.": [66], "It": [67], "goes": [68], "on,": [69], "however,": [70], "discuss": [72], "other": [73], "views": [74], "easily": [77], "private": [82], "office": [83], "supplement": [85], "these": [86], "radiographs.": [87]}, "authors": ["Bernard Friedland"], "abstract": "Radiology has long played a critical role in the treatment planning of theorthodontic patient.

Only a few studies have investigated the risk factors for progressive osteoporotic compression spine fractures. The purpose of this study was to investigate clinical and radiological factors related to progressive collapse following acute osteoporotic compression spine fractures. We retrospectively identified all patients treated for thoracolumbar fractures in our institution between January 2008 and July 2013. Included cases were examined by plain radiographs and CT scans. For each patient we classified the fracture according to the AOSpine Thoracolumbar Spine Injury Classification System. The difference between initial and final height loss and initial and final local kyphosis was documented as height loss difference and kyphotic angle difference. The presence of old fractures and intravertebral cleft were also documented. The study included 153 patients, comprising 102 women and 51 men. The mean patient age was 68.9 years. The mean length of follow up was 15 months. A statistically significant correlation was found between patient age, final height loss, height loss difference and kyphotic angle difference.

METHODS: The epidemiological, clinical and radiological lung findings of 44 patients with paracoccidiodomycosis (PCM) were evaluated. Patients were divided into two groups of 23 and 21 individuals according to the presence (group 1) or absence (group 2) of chest X-ray abnormalities, respectively, and their clinical data was analyzed with the aid of statistical tools. RESULTS: As a general rule, patients were rural workers, young adult males and smokers - group 1 and 2, respectively: males (91.3% and 66.7%); mean age (44.4 and 27.9 year-old); smoking (34.7% and 71.4 %); acute/subacute presentation (38.1% and 21.7%); chronic presentation (61.9% and 78.3%). The most frequent respiratory manifestations were - group 1 and 2, respectively: cough (25% and 11.4%) and dyspnea (22.7% and 6.8%). No statistical difference was observed in pulmonary signs and symptoms between patients with or without radiographic abnormalities. The most frequent radiological finding was nodular (23.8%) or nodular-fibrous (19%), bilateral (90.5%) and diffuse infiltrates (85.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Absence of statistical difference in pulmonary signs and symptoms between these two groups of patients with PCM indicates clinical-radiological dissociation. A simplified classification of radiological lung PCM findings is suggested, based on correlation of these data and current literature review."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W3022021772", "relevance_score": 218.21707, "publication_year": 2007, "title": "Scope of radiological protection control measures.", "cited_by_count": 29, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Scope (computer science)", "level": 2, "score": 0.8414711}, {"display_name": "Radiological weapon", "level": 2, "score": 0.7912306}, {"display_name": "Risk analysis (engineering)", "level": 1, "score": 0.64351594}, {"display_name": "Commission", "level": 2, "score": 0.5983248}, {"display_name": "Radiation protection", "level": 2, "score": 0.55773616}, {"display_name": "Control (management)", "level": 2, "score": 0.5352004}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"In": [0], "this": [1], "report,": [2], "the": [3, 14, 37, 46, 66, 84, 105, 115, 119, 126, 139, 185, 197, 201, 204, 209], "Commission": [4], "recommends": [5], "approaches": [6], "to": [7, 74, 163, 193, 216], "national": [8, 222], "authorities": [9], "for": [10, 35, 63, 97, 124, 134, 195, 207], "their": [11, 50, 69], "definition": [12], "of": [13, 16, 27, 107, 128, 141], "scope": [15, 127], "radiological": [17, 129], "protection": [18, 130], "control": [19, 52, 71], "measures": [20], "through": [21], "regulations,": [22, 131], "by": [23, 45, 95], "using": [24], "its": [25], "principles": [26], "justification": [28], "and": [29, 77, 112, 138, 148, 177], "optimisation.": [30], "The": [31, 153, 181], "report": [32, 120, 154, 186], "provides": [33, 81], "advice": [34, 82], "deciding": [36], "radiation": [38], "exposure": [39, 136, 146, 151, 158, 162], "situations": [40, 85, 147, 159, 210], "that": [41, 59, 203, 211], "should": [42], "be": [43, 54, 61, 75, 93, 213, 217], "covered": [44], "relevant": [47], "regulations": [48, 67], "because": [49, 68, 104], "regulatory": [51, 70, 198], "can": [53, 212], "justified,": [55], "and,": [56], "conversely,": [57], "those": [58], "may": [60, 92], "considered": [62, 94], "exclusion": [64, 122], "from": [65, 87, 99], "is": [72, 110, 114], "deemed": [73], "unamenable": [76], "unjustified.": [78], "It": [79], "also": [80, 155], "on": [83, 221], "resulting": [86], "regulated": [88, 218], "circumstances": [89], "but": [90], "which": [91], "regulators": [96, 194], "exemption": [98, 113, 132], "complying": [100], "with": [101], "specific": [102, 157], "requirements": [103, 109], "application": [106, 140], "these": [108, 142], "unwarranted": [111], "optimum": [116], "option.": [117], "Thus,": [118], "describes": [121], "criteria": [123, 133, 183], "defining": [125, 196], "planned": [135], "situations,": [137], "concepts": [143], "in": [144, 149, 184, 200], "emergency": [145], "existing": [150], "situations.": [152], "addresses": [156], "such": [160], "as": [161, 190], "low-energy": [164], "or": [165, 214], "low-intensity": [166], "adventitious": [167], "radiation,": [168, 170], "cosmic": [169], "naturally": [171], "occurring": [172], "radioactive": [173, 179], "materials,": [174], "radon,": [175], "commodities,": [176], "low-level": [178], "waste.": [180], "quantitative": [182], "are": [187], "intended": [188], "only": [189], "generic": [191], "suggestions": [192], "scope,": [199], "understanding": [202], "definitive": [205], "boundaries": [206], "establishing": [208], "need": [215], "will": [219], "depend": [220], "approaches.": [223]}, "authors": ["AJ Gonz\u00e1lez", "GC Mason", "RH Clarke", "AD Wrixon", "John R.

The report provides advice for deciding the radiation exposure situations that should be covered by the relevant regulations because their regulatory control can be justified, and, conversely, those that may be considered for exclusion from the regulations because their regulatory control is deemed to be unamenable and unjustified. It also provides advice on the situations resulting from regulated circumstances but which may be considered by regulators for exemption from complying with specific requirements because the application of these requirements is unwarranted and exemption is the optimum option. Thus, the report describes exclusion criteria for defining the scope of radiological protection regulations, exemption criteria for planned exposure situations, and the application of these concepts in emergency exposure situations and in existing exposure situations. The report also addresses specific exposure situations such as exposure to low-energy or low-intensity adventitious radiation, cosmic radiation, naturally occurring radioactive materials, radon, commodities, and low-level radioactive waste. The quantitative criteria in the report are intended only as generic suggestions to regulators for defining the regulatory scope, in the understanding that the definitive boundaries for establishing the situations that can be or need to be regulated will depend on national approaches."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2151680402", "relevance_score": 213.73074, "publication_year": 1976, "title": "The Value of Individual Joints for Radiologic Assessment of Rheumatoid Arthritis", "cited_by_count": 29, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Rheumatoid arthritis", "level": 2, "score": 0.9334452}, {"display_name": "Arthritis", "level": 2, "score": 0.5231422}, {"display_name": "Internal medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.38009316}, {"display_name": "Physical therapy", "level": 1, "score": 0.36378044}, {"display_name": "Surgery", "level": 1, "score": 0.3244854}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Twenty-seven": [0], "bilateral": [1], "joints": [2, 32, 40, 88], "of": [3, 16, 20, 44, 53, 66, 76, 90, 101, 103], "28": [4], "patients": [5], "with": [6, 55], "rheumatoid": [7, 45, 91, 104], "arthritis": [8, 46, 105], "were": [9], "radiographed": [10], "and": [11, 33, 61], "divided": [12], "into": [13], "six": [14], "grades": [15], "severity": [17, 102], "by": [18, 82], "means": [19], "standard": [21, 64], "reference": [22], "films.": [23], "The": [24, 93], "results": [25], "indicated": [26], "that": [27, 71], "the": [28, 34, 37, 42, 50, 57, 62], "four": [29], "lateral": [30], "metatarsophalangeal": [31], "wrists": [35], "are": [36], "most": [38], "valuable": [39], "for": [41, 95], "assessment": [43, 78], "as": [47], "they": [48], "show": [49], "strongest": [51], "correlation": [52], "involvement": [54], "duration,": [56], "highest": [58], "slope": [59], "value,": [60], "lowest": [63], "deviation": [65], "involvement.": [67], "It": [68], "was": [69], "concluded": [70], "many": [72], "currently": [73], "used": [74], "methods": [75], "radiologic": [77, 85], "could": [79], "be": [80], "improved": [81], "evaluating": [83], "proper": [84], "changes": [86], "in": [87], "representative": [89], "arthritis.": [92], "need": [94], "a": [96], "new": [97], "generally": [98], "accepted": [99], "classification": [100], "is": [106], "evident": [107], "from": [108], "this": [109], "paper.": [110]}, "authors": ["Arvi Larsen"], "abstract": "Twenty-seven bilateral joints of 28 patients with rheumatoid arthritis were radiographed and divided into six grades of severity by means of standard reference films.

Solid masses include neurofibroma, ganglioneuroma, leiomyoma, lipoma, and perivascular epithelioid cell tumor (PEComa). Schwannomas and desmoid tumors can be solid or cystic. Cystic tumors include mature cystic teratoma and lymphangioma. Lipoma, PEComa, and mature cystic teratoma can contain fat, and ganglioneuroma and mature cystic teratoma may contain calcification.

We feel that this can be achieved only by the radiologist coming to realize that he is not a mere pattern-matcher but in truth a pathologist working with different tools. The radiologist must move in constant contact with his pathologist in order to ferret out the meanings of the plethora of shadows that greet him in his daily task. The Case of the Month from the A FIP, beginning in this issue, is dedicated to that legendary radiological pathologist, Colonel Roy Thompson, our consultant and former chief. It is our hope that these cases will stimulate the radiologist toward looking beyond the viewbox to find further understanding of the disease he encounters. Clinical Report A full-term white female infant was considered normal at birth, but moderate respiratory distress and cyanosis developed about six hours afterward. The disorder progressed inexorably, and by the end of the first day of life breathing became labored with thoracic retractions. The child was then admitted to the hospital thirty hours after birth. Clinical and radiological work-up resulted in a tentative diagnosis of anomalous pulmonary venous return, particularly in view of what was considered evidence of prominent pulmonary vessels and pulmonary venous hypertension. A cineangiocardiogram was considered normal, however, demonstrating neither shunt nor obstruction. The patient eventually died on the seventh day despite oxygen, digitalis, and antibiotic therapy. No clear-cut diagnosis had been achieved, although congenital vesicular emphysema, neonatal atelectasis, and hyaline membrane disease had been considered. Radiologic Findings The admission chest films, taken when the child was thirty hours of age (Fig. 1, A\u2013B), show hyperventilation with marked depression of the diaphragm and bowing of the sternum. An associated pneumothorax is easily seen just above the left costophrenic angle on a follow-up film (Fig. 1, C). The lung fields are hyperlucent but show diffuse arborizing linear and reticulate densities in the distribution of the vascular markings. At first, the overall impression might be that of severe hyper-vascularity but the heart is small and relatively normal in contour, and as noted above there was no clinical or laboratory evidence of cardiovascular disease. Close examination of the lung fields in Figure 1, D shows a reticulate pattern of ramifying densities alternating with lucent cyst-like formations in a pattern reminiscent of the fibrocystic appearance of the lungs in the end-stages of diffuse interstitial fibrosis."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W1967221541", "relevance_score": 202.9584, "publication_year": 2010, "title": "Papillary Glioneuronal Tumor: Radiological Evidence of a Newly Established Tumor Entity", "cited_by_count": 29, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Magnetic resonance imaging", "level": 2, "score": 0.6300961}, {"display_name": "Differential diagnosis", "level": 2, "score": 0.6002458}, {"display_name": "Pathology", "level": 1, "score": 0.5784937}, {"display_name": "Nodule (geology)", "level": 2, "score": 0.5682359}, {"display_name": "Radiological weapon", "level": 2, "score": 0.55724305}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.5240924}, {"display_name": "Lesion", "level": 2, "score": 0.51404226}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Papillary": [0], "glioneuronal": [1], "tumor": [2, 12, 24, 185], "(PGNT)": [3], "was": [4, 60, 91, 103, 129, 172], "newly": [5, 183], "classified": [6], "as": [7, 96], "a": [8], "Grade": [9], "I": [10], "neuronal-glial": [11], "by": [13, 98], "2007": [14], "revision": [15], "of": [16, 23, 25, 31, 57, 72, 84, 156], "the": [17, 89, 104, 123, 133], "World": [18], "Health": [19], "Organization": [20], "(WHO)": [21], "classification": [22], "central": [26], "nervous": [27], "system": [28], "(CNS)": [29], "because": [30], "its": [32], "characteristic": [33, 111], "pseudopapillae": [34], "and": [35, 48, 74, 78, 88, 100, 116, 126, 169], "diphase": [36], "differentiation": [37], "features.": [38], "Previous": [39], "literature": [40, 75, 90], "has": [41], "laid": [42], "particular": [43], "emphasis": [44], "on": [45], "pathology": [46, 79], "manifestations,": [47], "radiological": [49, 175], "features": [50, 67, 80], "were": [51, 86, 94, 120], "only": [52], "briefly": [53], "mentioned.": [54], "The": [55, 146], "purpose": [56], "this": [58, 182], "study": [59], "to": [61], "describe": [62], "magnetic": [63], "resonance": [64], "imaging": [65], "(MRI)": [66], "through": [68], "reporting": [69], "2": [70, 82], "cases": [71, 83, 162], "PGNT": [73, 85, 97, 157], "review.MRI": [76], "findings": [77, 155, 176], "in": [81, 122], "reported": [87], "reviewed.Both": [92], "patients": [93], "confirmed": [95], "surgery": [99], "pathology.": [101], "Seizure": [102], "main": [105], "clinical": [106], "manifestation.": [107], "Histopathological": [108], "examination": [109], "revealed": [110], "pseudopapillary": [112], "structure": [113], "with": [114, 132, 143, 166], "astrocytes": [115], "neurons.": [117], "Both": [118], "lesions": [119], "located": [121], "temporal": [124], "lobe,": [125], "one": [127], "case": [128], "closely": [130], "related": [131], "lateral": [134], "ventricle.": [135], "MRI": [136], "showed": [137, 163], "cystic-solid": [138], "mass": [139, 165], "or": [140], "cystic": [141, 164], "lesion": [142], "mural": [144, 167], "nodule.": [145], "solid": [147], "component": [148], "enhanced": [149], "strikingly": [150], "after": [151], "contrast": [152], "agent": [153], "administration.MRI": [154], "present": [158], "certain": [159], "characteristics.": [160], "Most": [161], "nodule": [168], "periventricular": [170], "location": [171], "common.": [173], "Although": [174], "can": [177], "provide": [178], "some": [179], "evidence": [180], "for": [181], "established": [184], "entity,": [186], "differential": [187], "diagnosis": [188], "is": [189], "still": [190], "needed.": [191]}, "authors": ["Hui Xiao", "Lin Ma", "Xin Lou", "Qiuping Gui"], "abstract": "Papillary glioneuronal tumor (PGNT) was newly classified as a Grade I neuronal-glial tumor by 2007 revision of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumor of central nervous system (CNS) because of its characteristic pseudopapillae and diphase differentiation features.

The purpose of this study was to describe magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features through reporting 2 cases of PGNT and literature review.MRI findings and pathology features in 2 cases of PGNT were reported and the literature was reviewed.Both patients were confirmed as PGNT by surgery and pathology. Seizure was the main clinical manifestation. Histopathological examination revealed characteristic pseudopapillary structure with astrocytes and neurons. Both lesions were located in the temporal lobe, and one case was closely related with the lateral ventricle. MRI showed cystic-solid mass or cystic lesion with mural nodule. The solid component enhanced strikingly after contrast agent administration.MRI findings of PGNT present certain characteristics. Most cases showed cystic mass with mural nodule and periventricular location was common.

Method A total of 597 patients (551 women, 46 men) who underwent cinedefecography between November 2001 and November 2005 were studied. A total of 567 (95%) underwent cinedefecography as they had symptoms of ODS. Enterocele was classified into three types. Results Enterocele was found in 127 (23%) female and one (2.2%) male patients. Thirty-eight (6.9%) patients had type A, 38(6.9%) type B, and 27(4.9%) type C enterocele. A total of 24 patients (4.35%) had sigmoidocele. In patients with type C enterocele, the finding of a radiological pattern of ODS was higher (26/27) than that in the other groups (A + B + Sigmoidocele) (23/100) (P < 0.001). An obstructed evacuation pattern was found in 49 (38.5%) patients with enterocele and in 148 (34.9%) patients in the control group. Conclusion Type C enterocele is often associated with a radiological pattern of ODS and usually presents as an isolated condition.

Objectives To derive the conversion factors between the entrance surface dose and the mean absorbed dose to the most radiation-sensitive organs, and to determine the dose level and its variation for patients. Summary of Background Data Fifty-five patients participated in the survey. Mathematically describable phantoms were used to simulate the body of children of various ages. Methods Relative absorbed dose in the body was determined with measurements. The entrance surface dose and the dose-area product were measured for a number of patients. The effective dose and its variation between patients were estimated. Results The mean entrance surface doses were highest for the lumbar spine examinations (2.6 mGy, anteroposterior projection; 6.7 mGy, lateral projection). The female gonads received the highest dose. The mean entrance surface doses for the thoracic spine examinations were 2.1 mGy for the frontal view and 6.1 mGy for the lateral view. The breasts, thyroid, lungs, and esophagus received the highest absorbed dose. Mean effective dose for one frontal and one lateral view was slightly higher for lumbar spine examinations than for thoracic spine examinations. An optimized scoliosis examination gives a much lower effective dose, about 0.05 mSv (frontal view). If an additional exposure determining the \u201cskeletal age\u201d is performed, the effective dose rises with 0.12 mSv. Conclusions Thoracic spine and lumbar spine examinations lead to relatively high-absorbed doses to radiation-sensitive organs. Because the scoliosis investigation is repeated several times, the total effective dose could be considerable."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2962761061", "relevance_score": 194.77771, "publication_year": 2017, "title": "Unsupervised Joint Mining of Deep Features and Image Labels for Large-Scale Radiology Image Categorization and Scene Recognition", "cited_by_count": 29, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Convolutional neural network", "level": 2, "score": 0.7846774}, {"display_name": "Artificial intelligence", "level": 1, "score": 0.77728486}, {"display_name": "Discriminative model", "level": 2, "score": 0.70965856}, {"display_name": "Categorization", "level": 2, "score": 0.69313574}, {"display_name": "Pascal (unit)", "level": 2, "score": 0.6096376}, {"display_name": "Pattern recognition (psychology)", "level": 2, "score": 0.5794576}, {"display_name": "Deep learning", "level": 2, "score": 0.55284715}, {"display_name": "Contextual image classification", "level": 3, "score": 0.5289521}, {"display_name": "Cluster analysis", "level": 2, "score": 0.5115119}, {"display_name": "Ground truth", "level": 2, "score": 0.49805284}, {"display_name": "Deep neural networks", "level": 3, "score": 0.46524274}, {"display_name": "Image (mathematics)", "level": 2, "score": 0.46125495}, {"display_name": "Task (project management)", "level": 2, "score": 0.44752797}, {"display_name": "Machine learning", "level": 1, "score": 0.41392222}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"The": [0, 183], "recent": [1], "rapid": [2], "and": [3, 27, 47, 63, 86, 94, 143, 173], "tremendous": [4], "success": [5], "of": [6, 23, 60, 82, 100, 202, 211], "deep": [7, 74, 83], "convolutional": [8], "neural": [9], "networks": [10], "(CNN)": [11], "on": [12, 171, 217], "many": [13], "challenging": [14], "computer": [15], "vision": [16], "tasks": [17], "largely": [18], "derives": [19], "from": [20], "the": [21, 24, 37, 57, 97, 163, 192, 206, 218], "accessibility": [22], "well-annotated": [25], "ImageNet": [26], "PASCAL": [28], "VOC": [29], "datasets.": [30], "Nevertheless,": [31], "unsupervised": [32], "image": [33, 87, 115, 135, 152], "categorization": [34, 153], "(i.e.,": [35], "without": [36], "ground-truth": [38], "labeling)": [39], "is": [40, 91, 125, 181], "much": [41], "less": [42], "investigated,": [43], "yet": [44], "critically": [45], "important": [46, 130], "difficult": [48], "when": [49], "annotations": [50], "are": [51, 155, 215], "extremely": [52], "hard": [53], "to": [54, 104, 117, 162, 205], "obtain": [55], "in": [56, 110, 127], "conventional": [58], "way": [59], "\"Google": [61], "Search\"": [62], "crowd": [64], "sourcing.": [65], "We": [66], "address": [67], "this": [68], "problem": [69], "by": [70], "presenting": [71], "a": [72, 140, 199], "looped": [73], "pseudo-task": [75], "optimization": [76], "(LDPO)": [77], "framework": [78], "for": [79, 147], "joint": [80], "mining": [81], "CNN": [84, 107], "features": [85], "labels.": [88], "Our": [89, 122], "method": [90, 124], "conceptually": [92], "simple": [93], "rests": [95], "upon": [96], "hypothesized": [98], "\"convergence\"": [99], "better": [101, 105, 151], "labels": [102], "leading": [103], "trained": [106], "models": [108], "which": [109], "turn": [111], "feed": [112], "more": [113, 119], "discriminative": [114], "representations": [116], "facilitate": [118], "meaningful": [120], "clusters/labels.": [121], "proposed": [123, 159, 179], "validated": [126], "tackling": [128], "two": [129], "applications:": [131], "1)": [132], "Large-scale": [133], "medical": [134], "annotation": [136], "has": [137], "always": [138], "been": [139], "prohibitively": [141], "expensive": [142], "easily-biased": [144], "task": [145], "even": [146], "well-trained": [148], "radiologists.": [149], "Significantly": [150], "results": [154], "achieved": [156], "via": [157], "our": [158, 178], "approach": [160], "compared": [161, 204], "previous": [164], "state-of-the-art": [165, 207], "method.": [166], "2)": [167], "Unsupervised": [168], "scene": [169, 188, 195], "recognition": [170], "representative": [172], "publicly": [174], "available": [175], "datasets": [176], "with": [177], "technique": [180], "examined.": [182], "LDPO": [184], "achieves": [185], "excellent": [186], "quantitative": [187], "classification": [189, 209], "results.": [190], "On": [191], "MIT": [193], "indoor": [194], "dataset,": [196], "it": [197], "attains": [198], "clustering": [200], "accuracy": [201, 210], "75:3%,": [203], "supervised": [208], "81:0%": [212], "(when": [213], "both": [214], "based": [216], "VGG-VD": [219], "model).": [220]}, "authors": ["Xiaosong Wang", "Le L\u00fc", "Hoo-Chang Shin", "Lauren Kim", "Mohammadhadi Bagheri", "Isabella Nogues", "Jianhua Yao", "Ronald M.

Nevertheless, unsupervised image categorization (i.e., without the ground-truth labeling) is much less investigated, yet critically important and difficult when annotations are extremely hard to obtain in the conventional way of \"Google Search\" and crowd sourcing. We address this problem by presenting a looped deep pseudo-task optimization (LDPO) framework for joint mining of deep CNN features and image labels. Our method is conceptually simple and rests upon the hypothesized \"convergence\" of better labels leading to better trained CNN models which in turn feed more discriminative image representations to facilitate more meaningful clusters/labels. Our proposed method is validated in tackling two important applications: 1) Large-scale medical image annotation has always been a prohibitively expensive and easily-biased task even for well-trained radiologists. Significantly better image categorization results are achieved via our proposed approach compared to the previous state-of-the-art method. 2) Unsupervised scene recognition on representative and publicly available datasets with our proposed technique is examined. The LDPO achieves excellent quantitative scene classification results. On the MIT indoor scene dataset, it attains a clustering accuracy of 75:3%, compared to the state-of-the-art supervised classification accuracy of 81:0% (when both are based on the VGG-VD model)."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2025565299", "relevance_score": 191.9062, "publication_year": 2013, "title": "Endothelial safety of radiological contrast media: Why being concerned", "cited_by_count": 29, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Vasomotor", "level": 2, "score": 0.5925842}, {"display_name": "Pathogenesis", "level": 2, "score": 0.573538}, {"display_name": "Microcirculation", "level": 2, "score": 0.5507553}, {"display_name": "Endothelial dysfunction", "level": 2, "score": 0.47952938}, {"display_name": "Contrast medium", "level": 2, "score": 0.47940657}, {"display_name": "Pathology", "level": 1, "score": 0.4421994}, {"display_name": "Vasodilation", "level": 2, "score": 0.4277898}, {"display_name": "Endothelium", "level": 2, "score": 0.41811025}, {"display_name": "Inflammation", "level": 2, "score": 0.41797012}, {"display_name": "Cardiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.33653843}, {"display_name": "Internal medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.30673143}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Iodinated": [0], "radiocontrast": [1, 71], "media": [2, 32, 59, 72, 114, 187], "have": [3], "been": [4, 34], "the": [5, 49, 76, 79, 90, 99, 118, 175, 183], "most": [6, 50], "widely": [7], "used": [8], "pharmaceuticals": [9], "for": [10], "intravascular": [11, 55], "administration": [12, 56], "in": [13, 82, 148, 165], "diagnostic": [14], "and": [15, 27, 60, 67, 86, 92, 103, 125, 133, 140, 152], "interventional": [16], "angiographic": [17], "procedures.": [18], "Although": [19], "they": [20], "are": [21, 73], "regarded": [22], "as": [23, 128, 130], "relatively": [24], "safe": [25], "drugs": [26], "vascular": [28, 83], "biocompatibility": [29], "of": [30, 48, 57, 64, 89, 101, 107, 112, 120, 135, 157, 177, 185], "contrast": [31, 58, 108, 113, 161, 186], "has": [33], "progressively": [35], "improved,": [36], "severe": [37], "adverse": [38, 105, 163], "reactions": [39, 106, 164], "may": [40], "occur,": [41], "among": [42], "which": [43], "acute": [44], "nephropathy": [45], "is": [46], "one": [47], "clinically": [51], "significant": [52], "complications": [53], "after": [54], "a": [61], "powerful": [62], "predictor": [63], "poor": [65], "early": [66], "long-term": [68], "outcomes.": [69], "Since": [70], "given": [74], "through": [75], "arterial": [77], "or": [78], "venous": [80], "circulation": [81], "procedures,": [84], "morphological": [85, 126], "functional": [87], "changes": [88], "microvascular": [91], "macrovascular": [93], "endothelial": [94, 131, 169], "cells": [95], "substantially": [96], "contribute": [97], "to": [98, 116, 174], "pathogenesis": [100, 184], "organ-specific": [102], "systemic": [104], "media.": [109], "Endothelial": [110], "toxicity": [111], "seems": [115], "be": [117], "result": [119], "both": [121], "direct": [122], "proapoptotic": [123], "effects": [124], "derangements,": [127], "well": [129], "dysfunction": [132], "induction": [134], "inflammation,": [136], "oxidative": [137], "stress,": [138], "thrombosis,": [139], "altered": [141], "vasomotor": [142], "balance,": [143], "with": [144], "predominant": [145], "vasoconstrictive": [146], "response": [147], "atherosclerotic": [149], "coronary": [150], "arteries": [151], "kidney": [153], "microcirculation.": [154], "Further": [155], "understanding": [156], "pathogenetic": [158], "mechanisms": [159], "underlying": [160], "media-induced": [162], "cellular": [166], "targets,": [167], "including": [168], "cells,": [170], "will": [171], "hopefully": [172], "lead": [173], "development": [176], "novel": [178], "preventive": [179], "strategies": [180], "appropriately": [181], "curbing": [182], "vasotoxicity.": [188]}, "authors": ["Egeria Scoditti", "Marika Massaro", "Maria Rosa Montinari"], "abstract": "Iodinated radiocontrast media have been the most widely used pharmaceuticals for intravascular administration in diagnostic and interventional angiographic procedures.

Since radiocontrast media are given through the arterial or the venous circulation in vascular procedures, morphological and functional changes of the microvascular and macrovascular endothelial cells substantially contribute to the pathogenesis of organ-specific and systemic adverse reactions of contrast media. Endothelial toxicity of contrast media seems to be the result of both direct proapoptotic effects and morphological derangements, as well as endothelial dysfunction and induction of inflammation, oxidative stress, thrombosis, and altered vasomotor balance, with predominant vasoconstrictive response in atherosclerotic coronary arteries and kidney microcirculation.

In this study, clinical assessment parameters included Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), while radiologic assessment parameters included disc height, segmental lordotic angle, and lumbar lordotic angle. At the last follow-up, the level of bone fusion was determined in accordance with the Brantigan and Steffee criteria for classification of fusion results. The VAS scores of back pain and radiating leg pain tended to improve postoperatively, and showed no significant difference among groups (p > 0.05). In terms of ODI, the results of functional assessments also indicated no significant difference among groups (p > 0.05). Similarly, there was no statistically significant difference in disc height, segmental lordotic angle, lumbar lordotic angle, and bone fusion depending on the number of fusion levels (p > 0.05).

All of them were subjected to clinical and biochemical evaluation, followed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Headache was seen in 17 children, 13 had confusion and drowsiness, 12 had nausea and vomiting, 10 patients had visual disturbances, seizure and dyspnoea. Only two had focal neurological deficit (one with right facial palsy and another with right lateral rectus palsy). Of these 19 children, 15 patients had hypertensive retinopathy and four had normal fundi. The positive MRI findings in 17/19 patients were: bilateral leukoencephalopathic changes in occipitoparietal region (9/17), diffuse white/grey matter lesion (3/17) patients, brain stem hyperintensity (2/17) and haemorrhagic lesions (3/17). On MRA, 12/19 patients had attenuation of cerebral arteries of different degree. On follow up, MRI findings resolved in all except three patients. All patients had normal MRA on follow up, except one with persistent minimal attenuation of middle cerebral artery and another had spasm in anterior, middle and posterior cerebral arteries. The intracranial abnormalities in these patients with severe hypertension were reversible in many of the cases after control of blood pressure was achieved. We therefore conclude that severe hypertension may lead to leuoencephalopathy, which had a wide radiological spectrum.

The increased utilization of screening examinations has led to growing demands for rapid and accurate diagnostic reporting. In modern breast imaging centers, full-field digital mammography (FFDM) has replaced traditional analog mammography, and this has opened new opportunities for developing computational frameworks to automate detection and diagnosis. Artificial intelligence (AI), and its subdomain of deep learning, is showing promising results and improvements on diagnostic accuracy, compared to previous computer-based methods, known as computer-aided detection and diagnosis. In this commentary, we review the current status of computational radiology, with a focus on deep neural networks used in breast cancer screening and diagnosis. Recent studies are developing a new generation of computer-aided detection and diagnosis systems, as well as leveraging AI-driven tools to efficiently interpret digital mammograms, and breast tomosynthesis imaging. The use of AI in computational radiology necessitates transparency and rigorous testing. However, the overall impact of AI to radiology workflows will potentially yield more efficient and standardized processes as well as improve the level of care to patients with high diagnostic accuracy."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W1990267891", "relevance_score": 181.57114, "publication_year": 2001, "title": "Review of the radiology in randomised controlled trials in open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of displaced intraarticular calcaneal fractures", "cited_by_count": 29, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Radiological weapon", "level": 2, "score": 0.71713144}, {"display_name": "Internal fixation", "level": 2, "score": 0.6761237}, {"display_name": "Radiography", "level": 2, "score": 0.59580564}, {"display_name": "Conservative treatment", "level": 2, "score": 0.57862234}, {"display_name": "Coronal plane", "level": 2, "score": 0.5715655}, {"display_name": "Reduction (mathematics)", "level": 2, "score": 0.55236757}, {"display_name": "Randomized controlled trial", "level": 2, "score": 0.54459256}, {"display_name": "Surgery", "level": 1, "score": 0.5402633}, {"display_name": "Prospective cohort study", "level": 2, "score": 0.42291516}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.37092522}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"The": [0, 93], "aim": [1], "of": [2, 11, 17, 25, 28, 32, 111, 155, 184], "this": [3], "study": [4], "was": [5, 98, 147, 150, 166], "to": [6, 79, 138, 169], "assess": [7], "the": [8, 26, 90, 140, 144, 156, 161, 194, 225], "radiological": [9], "evaluation": [10, 215], "all": [12], "prospective,": [13], "randomised,": [14, 178, 202], "controlled": [15, 179, 203], "trails": [16], "displaced": [18], "intraarticular": [19], "calcaneal": [20], "fractures.": [21], "A": [22], "systematic": [23], "review": [24], "literature,": [27], "which": [29, 186], "only": [30, 176], "three": [31, 177], "296": [33], "references": [34], "were": [35, 39], "randomised": [36], "and": [37, 53, 69, 100, 115, 123, 207, 213], "controlled,": [38], "examined": [40], "in": [41, 89, 158, 193], "a": [42, 55], "blinded": [43, 153, 208], "fashion.": [44], "All": [45], "had": [46, 113], "preoperative": [47, 131], "coronal": [48], "CT": [49, 137, 212], "for": [50], "Sander's": [51], "classification": [52], "used": [54, 66, 130], "lateral": [56, 68, 132], "surgical": [57], "approach": [58], "or": [59, 119], "conservative": [60, 91, 145, 198], "treatment.": [61], "Thordason": [62], "(15": [63], "patients/11": [64], "controls)": [65, 107, 129], "interoperative": [67], "axial": [70], "X-rays.": [71], "Bohler's": [72, 114], "angle": [73, 117], "increased": [74], "on": [75], "average": [76], "from": [77], "11": [78], "26": [80], "degrees": [81, 87], "(P<0.001)": [82], "postoperatively,": [83, 122], "but": [84, 134, 196], "decreased": [85], "(9-8": [86], ")": [88], "group.": [92, 199], "posterior": [94], "facet": [95], "residual": [96], "displacement": [97], "1.1": [99], "4.7": [101], "mm,": [102], "respectively.": [103], "O'Farrell": [104], "(12": [105], "patients/12": [106], "showed": [108, 187], "8": [109], "out": [110], "12": [112], "Gissane's": [116], "partially": [118], "fully": [120], "restored": [121], "not": [124, 197], "conservatively.": [125], "Parmar": [126], "(25": [127], "patients/31": [128], "radiographs,": [133], "failed": [135], "with": [136, 205, 210], "grade": [139], "postoperative": [141, 195], "reduction,": [142], "whilst": [143], "group": [146], "unaltered.": [148], "There": [149], "no": [151], "systematic,": [152], "assessment": [154, 209], "change": [157], "radiology": [159], "by": [160], "operative": [162], "intervention.": [163], "Overall": [164], "there": [165, 174], "weak": [167], "evidence": [168], "support": [170], "ORIF.": [171], "In": [172], "conclusion,": [173], "are": [175], "studies": [180], "involving": [181], "small": [182], "numbers": [183], "patients,": [185], "improved": [188], "plain": [189], "radiographic": [190], "anatomical": [191], "alignment,": [192], "Further": [200], "prospective": [201], "trials": [204], "independent": [206], "accurate": [211], "clinical": [214], "will": [216], "be": [217, 222], "required": [218], "before": [219], "ORIF": [220], "can": [221], "adopted": [223], "as": [224], "best": [226], "practice.": [227]}, "authors": ["Paula J.

All had preoperative coronal CT for Sander's classification and used a lateral surgical approach or conservative treatment. Thordason (15 patients/11 controls) used interoperative lateral and axial X-rays. Bohler's angle increased on average from 11 to 26 degrees (P<0.001) postoperatively, but decreased (9-8 degrees ) in the conservative group. The posterior facet residual displacement was 1.1 and 4.7 mm, respectively. O'Farrell (12 patients/12 controls) showed 8 out of 12 had Bohler's and Gissane's angle partially or fully restored postoperatively, and not conservatively. Parmar (25 patients/31 controls) used preoperative lateral radiographs, but failed with CT to grade the postoperative reduction, whilst the conservative group was unaltered. There was no systematic, blinded assessment of the change in radiology by the operative intervention. Overall there was weak evidence to support ORIF. In conclusion, there are only three randomised, controlled studies involving small numbers of patients, which showed improved plain radiographic anatomical alignment, in the postoperative but not conservative group. Further prospective randomised, controlled trials with independent and blinded assessment with accurate CT and clinical evaluation will be required before ORIF can be adopted as the best practice."},

"To provide an evidence-based guide for the MRI interpretation of complete tumor response after neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (CRT) for rectal cancer using visual assessment on T2-weighted imaging (T2) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI).PubMed MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched on November 28, 2019 to identify articles on the following issues: 1) sensitivity and specificity of T2 or DWI for diagnosing pathologic complete response (pCR) and the criteria for MRI diagnosis; 2) MRI alone vs. MRI combined with other test(s) in sensitivity and specificity for pCR; and 3) tests to select patients for the watch-and-wait management. Eligible articles were selected according to meticulous criteria and were synthesized.Of 1615 article candidates, 55 eligible articles (for all three issues combined) were identified. Combined T2 and DWI performed better than T2 alone, with a meta-analytic summary sensitivity of 0.62 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.43-0.77; I\u00b2 = 80.60) and summary specificity of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.80-0.94; I\u00b2 = 92.61) for diagnosing pCR. The criteria for the complete response on T2 in most studies had the commonality of remarkable tumor decrease to the absence of mass-like or nodular intermediate signal, although somewhat varied, as follows: (near) normalization of the wall; regular, thin, hypointense scar in the luminal side with (near) normal-appearance or homogeneous intermediate signal in the underlying wall; and hypointense thickening of the wall. The criteria on DWI were the absence of a hyperintense signal at high b-value (\u2265 800 sec/mm\u00b2) in most studies. The specific algorithm to combine T2 and DWI was obscure in half of the studies. MRI combined with endoscopy was the most utilized means to select patients for the watch-and-wait management despite a lack of strong evidence to guide and support a multi-test approach.This systematic review and meta-analysis provide an evidence-based practical guide for MRI assessment of complete tumor response after CRT for rectal cancer."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2329632208",

To determine predictors of outcome in patients undergoing surgical treatment of spinal dural arteriovenous fistula (SDAVF). Summary of Background Data. Most previous studies assessing postoperative outcome in patients with SDAVF have been limited due to small population size, lack of sufficient information on presurgical variables, or short time of postoperative follow-up. Consequently, the most reliable predictors of functional outcome after treatment of SDAVF are not yet well established. Methods. Retrospective analysis of consecutive patients with SDAVF treated surgically between June 1985 and March 2008 in our institution. The Aminoff-Logue gait (G) and micturition (M) scores were used to stratify the degree of disability and the G + M score was used as the primary outcome measure. Demographics, clinical presentation, time to diagnosis, fistula level, presurgical motor and sphincter impairment, and magnetic resonance imaging findings were assessed as prognosticators for postoperative outcomes. Results. One hundred fifty-three patients were analyzed. Mean follow-up was 31 \u00b1 36.2 months. Most patients were improved (44%) or stable (34%) upon the last follow-up. Among preoperative variables, worsening weakness with exertion was associated with a better G + M score at the last follow-up (P < 0.001) and presence of pinprick level was associated with a worse G + M score at the last follow-up (P = 0.020). On multivariable analysis, worsening weakness with exertion was associated with better outcome at the last follow-up, and higher G score at presentation and higher G + M score at discharge were associated with worse outcome at the last follow-up. Magnetic resonance images obtained postoperatively for 104 patients (mean, 19.1 \u00b1 22.5 mo) showed complete resolution or improvement of the presurgical T2 signal abnormalities in 83.6% of cases. Changes in postoperative magnetic resonance image and fistula level did not correlate with functional outcomes. Conclusion. The degree of preoperative disability from SDAFV does not determine who will benefit most from surgery and even patients with severe deficits can improve after treatment. Patients with preoperative exertional claudication and without pinprick level on examination have greater chances of postsurgical improvement. Level of Evidence: 4 In a large series of patients with spinal dural arteriovenous fistula (SDAVF) treated surgically we found a favorable long-term outcome. Better postoperative outcome was predicted by preoperative exertional claudication and worse outcome by more severe preoperative motor deficits, but even patients with severe preoperative disability could benefit substantially from surgery."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2406093791", "relevance_score": 165.77164, "publication_year": 2016, "title": "Trends and Developments Shaping the Future of

The correlation between preoperative and postoperative lateral functional radiograms and clinical results was analyzed in 74 cases of myelopathy treated by anterior cervical fusion. Objectives. To clarify the correlation between clinical results and radiologic findings (developmental and dynamic stenosis). Summary of Background Data. Although radiologic changes have been reported at the disc level adjacent to anterior cervical fusion, the question of whether these radiologic findings affect the clinical results of anterior fusion has not been resolved. Methods. The \u201cdeteriorated\u201d results group (28 cases) was composed of cases with deterioration of 2 points or more in the Japan Orthopedic Association score at follow-up compared with the postoperative best score. The \u201cgood\u201d results group (46 cases) exhibited a recovery rate of \u2265 50%. The two groups were compared in lateral functional roentgenograms on which the sagittal canal diameter in each vertebra and the diameter between the inferoposterior lip of the vertebral body and the anterior margin of the lamina of the distal vertebra in the extended neck were measured. A diameter of less than 12 mm was defined as developmental canal stenosis or dynamic canal stenosis. Results. Fifty-four percent of the cases in the deteriorated results group had developmental canal stenosis, whereas the same findings were identified in only 2% of the cases in the good results group (P < 0.01). Preoperative dynamic canal stenosis at the disc level adjacent to the fusion was found in 64% of the patients in the deteriorated results group and in only 4% of the patients in the good results group (P < 0.01). Conclusions. Patients in the deteriorated results group showed a higher incidence of preoperative developmental and/or dynamic canal stenosis at the adjacent disc level than those in the the good results group. These results indicate that patients with preoperative developmental canal stenosis are not suitable candidates for anterior cervical fusion. When dynamic canal stenosis is found below or above the level of fusion, simultaneous fusion is recommended to avoid deterioration of the myelopathy."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2022725678", "relevance_score": 151.09299, "publication_year": 1992, "title": "Inferior Mastoidectomy-Hypotympanic Approach for Surgical Removal of Glomus Jugulare Tumors: An Anatomical and Radiologic Study Emphasizing Distances Between Critical Structures", "cited_by_count": 29, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Mastoidectomy", "level": 3, "score": 0.88102174}, {"display_name": "Neurovascular bundle", "level": 2, "score": 0.7099228}, {"display_name": "Skull", "level": 2, "score": 0.7035183}, {"display_name": "Dissection (medical)", "level": 2, "score": 0.66967076}, {"display_name": "Anatomy", "level": 1, "score": 0.5890343}, {"display_name": "Cholesteatoma", "level": 2, "score": 0.58259493}, {"display_name": "Middle ear", "level": 2, "score": 0.5613294}, {"display_name": "Temporal bone", "level": 2, "score": 0.5213855}, {"display_name": "Gross anatomy", "level": 2, "score": 0.48144835}, {"display_name": "Jugular foramen", "level": 3, "score": 0.4293712}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.35882422}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"The": [0, 122], "technique": [1], "of": [2, 8, 22, 85, 88, 103, 110, 118, 132, 155, 160, 171], "inferior": [3, 123], "mastoidectomy-hypotympanic": [4, 124], "dissection,": [5, 147], "with": [6, 39, 144, 158], "preservation": [7, 159], "the": [9, 26, 33, 40, 68, 72, 101, 107, 119, 130, 137, 152, 169, 172], "middle": [10, 163], "and": [11, 37, 51, 93, 115, 162, 175], "inner": [12, 75], "ear": [13, 76, 164], "structures,": [14, 70], "has": [15, 126], "been": [16, 127], "established": [17], "for": [18, 151], "radical": [19, 153], "surgical": [20, 108], "removal": [21, 109, 131, 154], "glomus": [23], "tumors": [24, 135], "involving": [25, 112, 136], "skull": [27, 120], "base.": [28, 121], "In": [29], "order": [30], "to": [31], "study": [32, 60, 84], "gross": [34, 89], "anatomic": [35], "differences": [36], "correlate": [38], "computed": [41], "tomography": [42], "(CT)": [43], "scan,": [44], "20": [45], "human": [46], "temporal": [47], "bones": [48], "were": [49, 57, 78], "dissected": [50], "accurate": [52], "measurements": [53], "between": [54, 67, 74], "vital": [55], "structures": [56, 77, 92, 165], "made.": [58], "This": [59, 82, 141], "revealed": [61], "a": [62], "wide": [63], "variation": [64], "in": [65, 100, 106, 129], "distances": [66, 73, 87], "neurovascular": [69], "whereas": [71], "not": [79], "statistically": [80], "different.": [81], "original": [83], "critical": [86], "topographic": [90], "anatomical": [91], "CT": [94], "correlation": [95], "is": [96, 148], "very": [97, 149], "helpful": [98], "indeed": [99], "understanding": [102], "variations": [104], "found": [105], "lesions": [111], "this": [113], "important": [114], "challenging": [116], "area": [117], "dissection": [125], "performed": [128], "six": [133], "suitable": [134], "jugular": [138], "bulb": [139], "area.": [140], "technique,": [142], "combined": [143], "upper": [145], "cervical": [146], "useful": [150], "such": [156], "neoplasms": [157], "external": [161], "as": [166, 168], "well": [167], "function": [170], "facial,": [173], "eighth,": [174], "other": [176], "lower": [177], "cranial": [178], "nerves.": [179]}, "authors": ["Anthony J.

In order to study the gross anatomic differences and correlate with the computed tomography (CT) scan, 20 human temporal bones were dissected and accurate measurements between vital structures were made. This study revealed a wide variation in distances between the neurovascular structures, whereas the distances between inner ear structures were not statistically different. This original study of critical distances of gross topographic anatomical structures and CT correlation is very helpful indeed in the understanding of variations found in the surgical removal of lesions involving this important and challenging area of the skull base. The inferior mastoidectomy-hypotympanic dissection has been performed in the removal of six suitable tumors involving the jugular bulb area. This technique, combined with upper cervical dissection, is very useful for the radical removal of such neoplasms with preservation of external and middle ear structures as well as the function of the

In Editor:We read with great interest the article \u201cRadiology Department Preparedness for COVID-19: Radiology Scientific Expert Panel\u201d by Dr Mossa-Basha and colleagues published online on March 16, 2020 (1). The authors summarized policies and procedures that radiology departments can apply to protect hospital workers and to treat patients during the emerging coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We would like to communicate our hospital experience in the northern part of Italy, located in the center of Milan.A rapid and unexpected surge of patients with COVID-19 is posing a serious threat to the Italian National Health Service (2). The prevalence of COVID-19 in the northern Italian population surged at the end of February 2020 and exploded in the past few days, resulting in overcrowding of emergency waiting rooms (3). In response, radiology departments, including our own, rushed to put in place strong operating procedures to support patients with COVID-19 while maintaining standard radiologic support for other patients and to reduce contagion.First, in our hospital, we isolated patients with COVID-19 from other patients. We now perform any radiologic investigation (chest radiography, CT, and US) of patients positive for or suspected of having COVID-19 in a dedicated radiology unit on the first floor of the emergency department. This unit is accessible from assigned elevators and paths from the emergency department and the intensive and subintensive COVID-19 care units. Moreover, a portable radiography device is inside the intensive care unit to reduce unnecessary handling of equipment.Second, the swab testing for COVID-19 does not provide information about disease severity and takes at least a few hours for test results. It may also have an initial false-negative result (4,5). Thus, we screen all patients presenting with respiratory symptoms or fever with chest radiography. When these radiographic findings are inconclusive or a there is a possible false-negative result, the patient undergoes chest CT. In cases of negative imaging results and clinical stability, we discharge patients without waiting for the results of the swab test and advise quarantine.The safe and immediate use of these imaging examinations upon arrival in our emergency department has shown success in speeding up the management of our patients. We recommend that other hospitals with similar situations evaluate such measures during this pandemic.Disclosures of Conflicts of Interest: M.A.O. disclosed no relevant relationships.

A retrospective clinical study with a follow-up of more than 4 years was conducted. Objectives. To know the radiologic changes in the interbody bone fusion site in patients who had received posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) using carbon fiber cages. Summary of Background Data. PLIF using cages is a popular surgical method for treating degenerative lumbar spinal diseases. However, there are few reports on the radiologic changes in the bone fusion site after this procedure. Method. Forty-one patients were observed (male-to-female ratio 12:29; mean age 51 years; 1-level-to-2-level PLIF 37:4) for 56 months (range 48\u201378). Anteroposterior and lateral radiograph films were taken from all patients immediately after bone fusion, at 6 and 12 months after surgery, and at follow-up. The extent of the bone fusion was classified as: only inside the cage; around the cage; extending to the vertebral cortical margin; and overgrowth beyond the vertebral cortical margin. The extent of bone fusion was observed anterior and posterior to the cages. Results. Of the 45 fusion levels examined in these 41 patients, successful bone fusion was observed in 40 levels of 36 patients (88%). All the successful fusions occurred inside and posterior to the cages. Of the 40 successful fusion levels at 6 and 12 months after surgery, 10% and 35% of the levels showed the fusion mass to be both inside and around the cages, while the remaining 90% and 65% of the levels showed the fusion mass only inside the cages, respectively. More than 4 years after surgery, 82% of the levels showed the fusion mass extending to the posterior cortical margin, and 2 levels (5%) with shallowly inserted cages showed bony overgrowth into the spinal canal. Conclusion. All the intervertebral bone fusion after PLIF occurred inside the cages and in the posterior intervertebral space. We suggest the complete removal of discmaterial and deep insertion of the cages to create sufficient posterior intervertebral space for bone growth. PLIF using cages impacted with laminar bone chips is a useful method when considering the time required for surgery and the morbidity of the autograft donor sites. The radiologic changes in the interbody bone fusion site after posterior lumbar interbody fusion using cages impregnated with laminar bone chips were followed-up for more than 4 years. Intervertebral bone fusion occurred in the posterior intervertebral space, which extended from the inside and around the cage. Posterior lumbar interbody fusion using cages impregnated with laminar bone chips is a useful method when considering the time required for surgery and the morbidity of the autograft donor sites."},

Radiology of the sacroiliac joint was investigated by obtaining different and multiple radiographs of cadaveric pelves marked with solder metal wire and radiopaque paint. Objectives. To demonstrate the orientation of the sacroiliac joint on various radiographic views. Summary of Background Data. Interpretation of the sacroiliac joint projection on plain radiography is difficult. It requires an understanding and appreciation of its components and their orientation. Emphasizing the definition of the orientation of the plane of the joint on the different projection views of the sacroiliac joints can aid the orthopaedic surgeon in obtaining the proper radiographs and in the proper interpretation of the different radiographic views. Methods. Nineteen sacroiliac joints from 10 cadaveric pelves, 5 males and 5 females, were studied. Each joint was found to be composed of three portions: anterosuperior, middle, and posteroinferior portions, each lying in a different plane. Each sacroiliac joint was marked with solder wires and radiopaque paint to define the orientation of each of the three portions of the joint on radiographs. The following radiographic projection views were taken for each joint: anteroposterior, lateral, inlet, craniocaudal axial, outlet, lithotomy, and oblique views. For the oblique views, the angulation of the x-ray tube needed to view each portion of the joint tangentially was recorded. Results. There was a wide variation in the orientation of the planes of the joint portions between the right and the left sides as well as between different pelves. Although the twisting of the plane of the whole joint produced by the successive examination of the portions could be either internal or external, it was the same bilaterally in a given specimen. The outlet and lithotomy views provided the best tangential representation of the two sacroiliac joints on one film. Conclusion. The sacroiliac joint is composed of three portions oriented in different planes. To study the sacroiliac joints, it seems desirable to obtain an anteroposterior view of the pelvis with the patient in a lithotomy position; then, if needed, each joint can be radiographed separately by using oblique views. It is important to note that the plane of the auricular portion of the joint can be directed from anterolateral to posteromedial, and therefore, the oblique views should be obtained accordingly."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2035015379", "relevance_score": 255.58154, "publication_year": 2014, "title": "Thalamic Lesions: A Radiological Review", "cited_by_count": 28, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Thalamus", "level": 2, "score": 0.7635822}, {"display_name": "Lesion", "level": 2, "score": 0.70336246}, {"display_name": "Radiological weapon", "level": 2, "score": 0.6874685}, {"display_name": "Pathology", "level": 1, "score": 0.53373545}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.4451319}, {"display_name": "Neuroscience", "level": 1, "score": 0.37057436}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Background": [0], ".": [1, 52], "Thalamic": [2], "lesions": [3, 37], "are": [4, 38], "seen": [5], "in": [6, 33, 43], "a": [7], "multitude": [8], "of": [9, 46, 63, 67, 70, 84, 96, 107], "disorders": [10], "including": [11], "vascular": [12], "diseases,": [13, 17, 24], "metabolic": [14], "disorders,": [15], "inflammatory": [16], "trauma,": [18], "tumours,": [19], "and": [20, 29, 104, 110, 113], "infections.": [21], "In": [22, 53], "some": [23], "thalamic": [25, 36, 64, 72], "involvement": [26], "is": [27], "typical": [28, 48], "sometimes": [30], "isolated,": [31], "while": [32], "other": [34, 47, 111], "diseases": [35], "observed": [39], "only": [40], "occasionally": [41], "(often": [42], "the": [44, 60, 68, 71, 76, 80, 82, 87, 94, 97, 102, 108], "presence": [45, 83], "extrathalamic": [49, 85], "lesions).": [50], "Summary": [51], "this": [54], "review,": [55], "we": [56], "will": [57], "mainly": [58], "discuss": [59], "MRI": [61, 92], "characteristics": [62], "lesions.": [65], "Identification": [66], "origin": [69], "lesion": [73], "depends": [74], "on": [75, 90], "exact": [77], "localisation": [78], "inside": [79], "thalamus,": [81], "lesions,": [86], "signal": [88], "changes": [89], "different": [91], "sequences,": [93], "evolution": [95], "radiological": [98, 112], "abnormalities": [99], "over": [100], "time,": [101], "history": [103], "clinical": [105], "state": [106], "patient,": [109], "nonradiological": [114], "examinations.": [115]}, "authors": ["Dimitri Renard", "Giovanni Castelnovo", "Chantal Campello", "S.

In some diseases, thalamic involvement is typical and sometimes isolated, while in other diseases thalamic lesions are observed only occasionally (often in the presence of other typical extrathalamic lesions). Summary . In this review, we will mainly discuss the MRI characteristics of thalamic lesions. Identification of the origin of the thalamic lesion depends on the exact localisation inside the thalamus, the presence of extrathalamic lesions, the signal changes on different MRI sequences, the evolution of the radiological abnormalities over time, the history and clinical state of the patient, and other radiological and nonradiological examinations."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2514751739", "relevance_score": 241.44266, "publication_year": 2016, "title": "New radiologic classification of renal angiomyolipomas", "cited_by_count": 28, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Angiomyolipoma", "level": 3, "score": 0.7641125}, {"display_name": "Nuclear medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.55257577}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.52006}, {"display_name": "Kappa", "level": 2, "score": 0.4936353}, {"display_name": "Internal medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.21539569}, {"display_name": "Kidney", "level": 2, "score": 0.21333238}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Purpose": [0], "To": [1], "introduce": [2], "a": [3, 34, 37, 82, 115, 182], "new": [4, 219], "radiologic": [5, 220], "classification": [6, 221], "of": [7, 94, 117, 147, 198, 211, 222, 238], "renal": [8, 223], "angiomyolipoma": [9], "(AML).": [10], "Materials": [11], "and": [12, 16, 36, 65, 74, 87, 98, 145, 169, 208], "methods": [13], "Between": [14], "1995": [15], "2014,": [17], "CT": [18, 129, 191], "or": [19, 59, 130, 192, 205], "MR": [20], "images": [21], "in": [22, 92, 234], "98": [23, 28], "patients": [24], "with": [25, 54, 71, 81], "histologically": [26], "proven": [27], "AMLs": [29, 89, 151, 200, 213], "were": [30, 41, 90, 152, 201], "reviewed": [31], "independently": [32], "by": [33], "radiologist": [35], "resident.": [38], "The": [39, 104, 218], "lesions": [40], "classified": [42], "as": [43, 203, 214], "(a)": [44], "53": [45], "fat-rich": [46, 199], "AML": [47, 52, 69, 207, 224], "(\u2264\u221210HU),": [48], "(b)": [49], "22": [50], "fat-poor": [51, 148, 204, 212], "(>\u221210HU)": [53, 70], "tumor-to-spleen": [55], "ratio": [56], "(TSR)": [57], "<0.71": [58], "signal": [60], "intensity": [61], "index": [62], "(SII)": [63], ">16.5%,": [64], "(c)": [66], "23": [67], "fat-invisible": [68, 88, 150, 206, 215], "TSR": [72], "\u22650.71": [73], "SII": [75, 99], "\u226416.5%.": [76], "Inter-reader": [77], "agreement": [78], "was": [79, 108, 120, 184], "assessed": [80], "weighted": [83, 105], "kappa": [84, 106], "value.": [85], "Fat-poor": [86], "compared": [91], "terms": [93], "attenuation": [95, 142], "value,": [96], "TSR,": [97], "using": [100], "unpaired": [101], "t-test.": [102], "Results": [103], "value": [107], "0.956": [109], "(95%": [110], "confidence": [111], "interval,": [112], "92.0\u201399.1%).": [113], "When": [114, 181], "region": [116], "interest": [118], "(ROI)": [119], "placed": [121, 185], "within": [122, 131, 186], "the": [123, 132, 140, 187, 236], "most": [124, 133], "hypodense": [125], "area": [126, 135, 189], "on": [127, 136, 190], "unenhanced": [128], "signal-dropped": [134], "chemical": [137, 193], "shift": [138, 194], "image,": [139], "mean": [141], "values,": [143], "TSRs,": [144], "SIIs": [146], "versus": [149, 157, 165, 173], "19.5": [153], "\u00b1": [154, 159, 163, 167, 171, 175], "8.1": [155], "HU": [156], "38.1": [158], "9.9": [160], "HU,": [161], "0.59": [162], "0.19": [164], "0.96": [166], "0.01,": [168], "43.7": [170], "16.9%": [172], "\u22125.4": [174], "21.1%,": [176], "respectively": [177], "(p": [178], "<": [179], "0.0001).": [180], "ROI": [183, 230], "other": [188], "images,": [195], "90.1%": [196], "(48/53)": [197], "mis-classified": [202], "50%": [209], "(11/22)": [210], "AML.": [216], "Conclusion": [217], "is": [225, 232], "feasible": [226], "for": [227], "clinical": [228], "practice.": [229], "location": [231], "important": [233], "differentiating": [235], "types": [237], "AMLs.": [239]}, "authors": ["Sohee Song", "Byung Kwan Park", "Jung Jae Park"], "abstract": "Purpose To introduce a new radiologic classification of renal angiomyolipoma (AML). Materials and methods Between 1995 and 2014, CT or MR images in 98 patients with histologically proven 98 AMLs were reviewed independently by a radiologist and a resident. The lesions were classified as (a) 53 fat-rich AML (\u2264\u221210HU), (b) 22 fat-poor AML (>\u221210HU) with tumor-to-spleen ratio (TSR) <0.71 or signal intensity index (SII) >16.5%, and (c) 23 fat-invisible AML (>\u221210HU) with TSR \u22650.71 and SII \u226416.5%. Inter-reader agreement was assessed with a weighted kappa value. Fat-poor and fat-invisible AMLs were compared in terms of attenuation value, TSR, and SII using unpaired t-test. Results The weighted kappa value was 0.956 (95% confidence interval, 92.0\u201399.1%). When a region of interest (ROI) was placed within the most hypodense area on unenhanced CT or within the most signal-dropped area on chemical shift image, the mean attenuation values, TSRs, and SIIs of fat-poor versus fat-invisible AMLs were 19.5 \u00b1 8.1 HU versus 38.1 \u00b1 9.9 HU, 0.59 \u00b1 0.19 versus 0.96 \u00b1 0.01, and 43.7 \u00b1 16.9% versus \u22125.4 \u00b1 21.1%, respectively (p < 0.0001). When a ROI was placed within the other area on CT or chemical shift images, 90.1% (48/53) of fat-rich AMLs were mis-classified as fat-poor or fat-invisible AML and 50% (11/22) of fat-poor AMLs as fat-invisible AML.

Methods All HPV+ OPC treated with definitive IMRT from 2010-2015 were included. Pre-treatment CT/MR of cN+ cases were reviewed by a head-neck radiologist for rENE. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were compared between rENE-positive (rENE+) vs rENE-negative (rENE\u2212). Multivariable analysis (MVA) for OS confirmed the prognostic value of rENE. Refined cN-classifications for new TNM staging proposals were evaluated against TNM-8 using established criteria. Results A total of 517 cN+ (rENE+: 97; rENE\u2212: 420) and 41 cN0 cases were identified. The rENE+ proportion increased with rising N-category (N1/N2/N3: 11%/19%/84%, p < 0.001). Median follow-up was 5.1 years. Compared to rENE\u2212, rENE+ patients had a lower 5-year OS (56% vs 85%) and DFS (46% vs 83%) overall, and in N1 (OS: 57% vs 89%; DFS: 51% vs 87%) and N2 subsets (OS: 45% and 76%; DFS: 33% vs 74%) (all p < 0.001). MVA confirmed the prognostic value of rENE for OS (HR = 3.86, p < 0.001) and DFS (HR = 3.89, p < 0.001). We proposed two new cN-classifications: Schema1 reclassified any N_rENE+ as New_N3; Schema2 reclassified N1_rENE+ as New_N2 and N2_rENE+ as New_N3. Stage incorporating either Schema1 (ranked 1st) or Schema2 (ranked 2nd) cN-categories outperformed TNM-8. Conclusion This study confirms that rENE is prognostically important and facilitates understanding of known outcome heterogeneity within TNM-8 in HPV+ OPC patients. rENE is a promising parameter to refine the TNM-8 cN-classifications."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W1977939247", "relevance_score": 229.77422, "publication_year": 2006, "title": "Problem-based learning: Concept, theories, effectiveness and application to radiology teaching", "cited_by_count": 28, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Problem-based learning", "level": 2, "score": 0.66945684}, {"display_name": "Curriculum", "level": 2, "score": 0.65004843}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.4206921}, {"display_name": "Medical education", "level": 1, "score": 0.39304757}, {"display_name": "Mathematics education", "level": 1, "score": 0.33103147}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Summary": [0], "Australian": [1], "and": [2, 25, 45, 50], "New": [3], "Zealand": [4], "medical": [5, 17], "schools": [6], "are": [7, 29], "partly": [8], "or": [9, 34], "entirely": [10], "incorporating": [11], "problem\u2010based": [12], "learning": [13], "(PBL)": [14], "in": [15], "their": [16], "school": [18], "curricula.": [19], "As": [20], "this": [21], "change": [22], "moves": [23], "forwards": [24], "gathers": [26], "momentum,": [27], "radiologists": [28], "called": [30], "upon": [31], "to": [32, 35, 37, 54], "facilitate": [33], "contribute": [36], "PBL": [38, 49], "tutorials.": [39], "This": [40], "study": [41], "explains": [42], "the": [43, 46], "concept": [44], "theories": [47], "of": [48], "discusses": [51], "its": [52], "application": [53], "radiology": [55], "teaching.": [56]}, "authors": ["Rathan M.

We created a hybrid NLP pipeline that integrates rule-based feature extraction modules and conditional random field (CRF) model for extraction of the measurements from the radiology reports and links them with clinically relevant features such as anatomical entities or imaging observations. The pipeline was trained on 1117 CT/MR reports, and performance of the system was evaluated on an independent set of 100 expert-annotated CT/MR reports and also tested on 25 mammography reports. The system detected 813 out of 806 measurements in the CT/MR reports; 784 were true positives, 29 were false positives, and 0 were false negatives. Similarly, from the mammography reports, 96% of the measurements with their modifiers were extracted correctly.

Two-hundred three patients with poststernotomy sternal wound infections were operated upon between 1984 and 1993. All pertinent clinical and radiological data of these patients were collected retrospectively and reinterpreted by an unbiased radiologist; the radiological data were correlated both to the intraoperative clinical findings and to histological interpretation of the surgical specimens. The study group available for statistical analysis included 160 patients. Predictive statistical analysis confirmed that computed tomography is a highly reliable imaging method for identifying the different pathologies as soft tissue, sternum mediastinal infections, in sternal wound infection with overall sensitivity of 93.5 percent and specificity of 81.7 percent. New radiographic findings were identified for the distinction of costochondral infection. This complication was, and still is, a major deceptive clinical problem in these patients and the major contributor to recurrences. We propose a sternal wound infection classification system that outlines the recommended approach for each clinical-radiological condition. Since computerized tomography was found to be a highly accurate modality, we strongly believe that the surgeon should take its pathological-radiographic findings into serious consideration, even if there are no \"clear-cut\" clinical signs for an existing or recurring infection."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2377892573", "relevance_score": 202.26407, "publication_year": 2016, "title": "Correlation between Radiological and Pathological Findings in Patients with Mycoplasma pneumoniae Pneumonia", "cited_by_count": 28, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Pathology", "level": 1, "score": 0.70907974}, {"display_name": "Lumen (anatomy)", "level": 2, "score": 0.6325883}, {"display_name": "Pneumonia", "level": 2, "score": 0.6154734}, {"display_name": "Mycoplasma pneumoniae", "level": 3, "score": 0.5754659}, {"display_name": "Pathological", "level": 2, "score": 0.57525295}, {"display_name": "Lung", "level": 2, "score": 0.49838185}, {"display_name": "Bronchitis", "level": 2, "score": 0.47269726}, {"display_name": "Mycoplasma pneumonia", "level": 4, "score": 0.45854855}, {"display_name": "Sputum", "level": 3, "score": 0.42121863}, {"display_name": "Mycoplasma", "level": 2, "score": 0.41210473}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Studies": [0], "focused": [1], "on": [2, 63, 94, 188], "the": [3, 20, 67, 78, 88, 101, 137, 152, 189, 208, 219], "pathological-radiological": [4], "correlation": [5], "of": [6, 27, 71, 166, 177, 193, 211, 221], "human": [7], "Mycoplasma": [8, 28], "(M)": [9], "pneumoniae": [10, 213], "pneumonia": [11, 214], "have": [12, 162], "rarely": [13], "been": [14], "reported.": [15], "Therefore,": [16], "we": [17], "extensively": [18], "reviewed": [19], "literature": [21], "regarding": [22], "pathological": [23, 209], "and": [24, 30, 38, 49, 98, 140, 149, 203], "radiological": [25, 182, 198], "studies": [26], "pneumonia,": [29], "compared": [31], "findings": [32], "between": [33], "open": [34], "lung": [35], "biopsy": [36], "specimen": [37], "computed": [39], "tomography": [40], "(CT).": [41], "Major": [42], "three": [43], "correlations": [44], "were": [45], "summarized.": [46], "1)": [47], "Peribronchial": [48], "perivascular": [50], "cuffing": [51], "characterized": [52], "by": [53, 169, 218], "mononuclear": [54], "cells": [55], "infiltration": [56], "was": [57, 66, 206], "correlated": [58], "with": [59, 82, 129, 142, 156], "bronchovascular": [60], "bundles": [61], "thickening": [62], "CT,": [64], "which": [65], "most": [68], "common": [69], "finding": [70], "this": [72], "pneumonia.": [73], "2)": [74], "Cellular": [75], "bronchitis": [76, 135], "in": [77, 87, 100, 136, 151], "small": [79, 138], "airways": [80, 139], "accompanied": [81], "exudates": [83, 99, 150], "or": [84, 109, 144], "granulation": [85], "tissue": [86], "lumen": [89, 103], "revealed": [90], "as": [91, 106], "centrilobular": [92, 157, 185], "nodules": [93, 158, 186], "CT.": [95], "3)": [96], "Neutrophils": [97], "alveolar": [102, 153], "radiologically": [104], "demonstrated": [105], "air-apace": [107], "consolidation": [108], "ground-glass": [110, 201], "opacities.": [111], "In": [112], "M.pulmonis-infected": [113], "mice": [114], "model,": [115], "pathologic": [116], "patterns": [117], "are": [118], "strikingly": [119], "different": [120], "according": [121], "to": [122, 132, 147, 184, 200], "host": [123, 178, 194, 222], "cell-mediated": [124], "immunity": [125], "(CMI)": [126], "levels;": [127], "treatment": [128, 141], "interleukin-2": [130], "lead": [131, 146], "marked": [133], "cellular": [134], "prednisolone": [143], "cyclosporin-A": [145], "neutrophils": [148], "lumen.": [154], "Patients": [155], "predominant": [159], "radiologic": [160], "pattern": [161, 183, 199], "a": [163], "high": [164], "level": [165, 220], "CMI,": [167], "measuring": [168], "tuberculin": [170], "skin": [171], "test.": [172], "From": [173], "these": [174], "findings,": [175], "up-regulation": [176], "CMI": [179, 195], "could": [180], "change": [181, 197], "predominant,": [187], "other": [190], "hand": [191], "down-regulation": [192], "would": [196], "opacity": [202], "consolidation.": [204], "It": [205], "suggested": [207], "features": [210], "M.": [212], "may": [215], "be": [216], "altered": [217], "CMI.": [223]}, "authors": ["Hiroshi Tanaka"], "abstract": "Studies focused on the pathological-radiological correlation of human Mycoplasma (M) pneumoniae pneumonia have rarely been reported. Therefore, we extensively reviewed the literature regarding pathological and radiological studies of Mycoplasma pneumonia, and compared findings between open lung biopsy specimen and computed tomography (CT). Major three correlations were summarized. 1) Peribronchial and perivascular cuffing characterized by mononuclear cells infiltration was correlated with bronchovascular bundles thickening on CT, which was the most common finding of this pneumonia. 2) Cellular bronchitis in the small airways accompanied with exudates or granulation tissue in the lumen revealed as centrilobular nodules on CT. 3) Neutrophils and exudates in the alveolar lumen radiologically demonstrated as air-apace consolidation or ground-glass opacities. In M.pulmonis-infected mice model, pathologic patterns are strikingly different according to host cell-mediated immunity (CMI) levels; treatment with interleukin-2 lead to marked cellular bronchitis in the small airways and treatment with prednisolone or cyclosporin-A lead to neutrophils and exudates in the alveolar lumen. Patients with centrilobular nodules predominant radiologic pattern have a high level of CMI, measuring by tuberculin skin test. From these findings, up-regulation of host CMI could change radiological pattern to centrilobular nodules predominant, on the other hand down-regulation of host CMI would change radiological pattern to ground-glass opacity and consolidation. It was suggested the pathological features of M. pneumoniae pneumonia may be altered by the level of host CMI."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2045811818", "relevance_score": 199.82211, "publication_year": 2014, "title": "Pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis in children: A spectrum of radiologic findings", "cited_by_count": 28, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Histiocytosis", "level": 3, "score": 0.75262654}, {"display_name": "Langerhans cell histiocytosis", "level": 3, "score": 0.63168746}, {"display_name": "Lung", "level": 2, "score": 0.526469}, {"display_name": "Population", "level": 2, "score": 0.46943593}, {"display_name": "Cystic fibrosis", "level": 2, "score": 0.4649559}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.46238437}, {"display_name": "High-resolution computed tomography", "level": 3, "score": 0.4345077}, {"display_name": "Pathology", "level": 1, "score": 0.39045745}, {"display_name": "Computed tomography", "level": 2, "score": 0.35767642}, {"display_name": "Disease", "level": 2, "score": 0.27006814}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Pulmonary": [0], "Langerhans": [1], "cell": [2], "histiocytosis": [3], "(PLCH)": [4], "is": [5, 13, 19, 93, 110], "a": [6, 37], "well": [7], "known": [8], "entity": [9], "in": [10, 16, 22, 25, 34, 44, 78, 95, 112, 118], "adults": [11, 23, 113], "but": [12, 114], "exceedingly": [14], "rare": [15], "children.": [17, 26, 119], "It": [18], "better": [20], "described": [21], "than": [24], "We": [27], "describe": [28], "the": [29, 45, 61, 101, 107], "current": [30], "understanding": [31], "of": [32, 39, 42, 63, 91], "PLCH": [33, 43, 54, 92], "children": [35], "and": [36, 86, 97], "spectrum": [38], "radiological": [40], "findings": [41], "paediatric": [46, 98], "population.": [47], "On": [48], "high": [49], "resolution": [50], "computed": [51], "tomography": [52], "(HRCT),": [53], "may": [55], "have": [56], "variable": [57], "appearance": [58], "depending": [59], "on": [60], "stage": [62], "disease,": [64], "ranging": [65], "from": [66], "small": [67], "interstitial": [68], "nodular": [69], "opacities": [70], "to": [71, 82], "multiple": [72], "thin/thick": [73], "walled": [74], "cysts": [75], "(often": [76], "bizarre": [77], "shape),": [79], "eventually": [80], "leading": [81], "marked": [83], "parenchymal": [84], "fibrosis": [85], "honeycomb": [87], "pattern.": [88], "CT": [89], "finding": [90], "similar": [94], "adult": [96], "populations": [99], "with": [100], "exception": [102], "that": [103], "lung": [104], "base": [105], "near": [106], "costophrenic": [108], "angle": [109], "spared": [111], "almost": [115], "always": [116], "involved": [117]}, "authors": ["Shahina Bano", "Vikas Chaudhary", "MK Narula", "Rama Anand", "V.

The purpose of this investigation was to study these issues in a large, population-based cohort of adolescents with cerebral palsy at transition into adult services. The cohort were a subset of a three year birth cohort (n = 98, 65M: 33F, with a mean age of 18.8 years (14.8 to 23.63) at their last radiological review) with the common features of a migration percentage greater than 30% and a history of adductor release surgery. Different radiological methods of measuring pelvic obliquity were investigated in 40 patients and the angle between the acetabular tear drops (ITDL) and the horizontal reference frame of the radiograph was found to be reliable, with good face validity. This was selected for further study in all 98 patients. The median pelvic obliquity was 4\u00b0 (interquartile range 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0).

These two groups crossed over in the second arm of the trial, which focused on computed tomography scans of the head, chest, and abdomen. At the conclusion of each arm of the trial, both groups completed an examination-style assessment, comprising questions both related and unrelated to the topics covered by the relevant adaptive tutorial. Online questionnaires were used to evaluate student perceptions of both learning resources.In both arms of the trial, the group using adaptive tutorials obtained significantly higher assessment scores than controls. This was because of higher assessment scores by senior students in the adaptive tutorial group when answering questions related to topics covered in those tutorials.

Barium sulphate was injected or infused into the abomasum via an implanted catheter; its passage through the intestine and associated muscular contractions were observed using X-ray image intensification. Once the normal pattern had been established for each individual, single or re-entrant cannulae were inserted into one of four positions in the small intestine. All the cannulations caused some disruption of the normal flow of digesta, causing retention of digesta and distension of the intestine around and proximal to the intraluminal flanges of the cannulae. The duodenum was affected the most, particularly by one type of re-entrant cannula which reduced the degree of jejunal filling; peristaltic contractions often failed to propagate beyond these cannulae and also caused some retrograde movement of digesta between the cannulation site and the duodenal bulb during the irregular contraction phase (ICP) of the migrating myoelectric complex (MMC). These re-entrant cannulae also impaired the clearing effect of regular contraction phase (RCP)."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2936894186", "relevance_score": 169.8498, "publication_year": 2019, "title": "Natural Language Processing for Automated Quantification of Brain Metastases Reported in Free-Text Radiology Reports", "cited_by_count": 28, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Artificial intelligence", "level": 1, "score": 0.6984813}, {"display_name": "Receiver operating characteristic", "level": 2, "score": 0.6866184}, {"display_name": "Lasso (programming language)", "level": 2, "score": 0.5716391}, {"display_name": "Calibration", "level": 2, "score": 0.5440466}, {"display_name": "Natural language processing", "level": 1, "score": 0.54158455}, {"display_name": "Text messaging", "level": 2, "score": 0.53721446}, {"display_name": "Head and neck", "level": 2, "score": 0.50181746}, {"display_name": "Magnetic resonance imaging", "level": 2, "score": 0.47381344}, {"display_name": "Text mining", "level": 2, "score": 0.43553525}, {"display_name": "Test set", "level": 2, "score": 0.43385965}, {"display_name": "Machine learning", "level": 1, "score": 0.3253068}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.2910084}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"PURPOSE": [0], "Although": [1], "the": [2, 39, 52, 136, 174, 179, 187, 231, 241, 259], "bulk": [3], "of": [4, 29, 41, 65, 74, 97, 151, 155, 192, 200, 209, 219, 261, 272], "patient-generated": [5], "health": [6], "data": [7, 17], "are": [8], "increasing": [9], "exponentially,": [10], "their": [11, 83], "use": [12], "is": [13], "impeded": [14], "because": [15], "most": [16], "come": [18], "in": [19, 103, 144, 245], "unstructured": [20], "format,": [21], "namely": [22], "as": [23, 266, 268], "free-text": [24, 250], "clinical": [25, 251, 270], "reports.": [26, 252], "A": [27, 149], "variety": [28], "natural": [30], "language": [31], "processing": [32, 40], "(NLP)": [33], "methods": [34], "have": [35], "emerged": [36], "to": [37, 47, 60, 69, 197, 205, 214, 224], "automate": [38], "free": [42], "text": [43, 57, 88], "ranging": [44], "from": [45, 249], "statistical": [46], "deep": [48], "learning\u2013based": [49], "models;": [50], "however,": [51], "optimal": [53], "approach": [54, 233], "for": [55, 85, 258], "medical": [56, 87], "analysis": [58], "remains": [59], "be": [61], "determined.": [62], "The": [63, 163], "aim": [64], "this": [66], "study": [67, 254], "was": [68], "provide": [70], "a": [71, 113, 236, 256, 269], "head-to-head": [72], "comparison": [73], "novel": [75], "NLP": [76, 127, 229, 264], "techniques": [77], "and": [78, 109, 125, 131, 141, 167, 216], "inform": [79], "future": [80], "studies": [81], "about": [82], "utility": [84], "automated": [86], "analysis.": [89], "PATIENTS": [90], "AND": [91], "METHODS": [92], "Magnetic": [93], "resonance": [94], "imaging": [95], "reports": [96, 138, 154], "patients": [98, 156, 273], "with": [99, 158, 183, 235, 275], "brain": [100, 159, 276], "metastases": [101, 160], "treated": [102], "two": [104, 119], "tertiary": [105], "centers": [106], "were": [107, 129, 161], "retrieved": [108], "manually": [110], "annotated": [111, 137], "using": [112], "binary": [114, 247], "classification": [115], "(single": [116], "metastasis": [117], "v": [118], "or": [120], "more": [121], "metastases).": [122], "Multiple": [123], "bag-of-words": [124, 232], "sequence-based": [126], "models": [128, 265], "developed": [130], "compared": [132], "after": [133], "randomly": [134], "splitting": [135], "into": [139], "training": [140], "test": [142, 181], "sets": [143], "an": [145, 184], "80:20": [146], "ratio.": [147], "RESULTS": [148], "total": [150], "1,479": [152], "radiology": [153], "diagnosed": [157, 274], "retrieved.": [162], "least": [164], "absolute": [165], "shrinkage": [166], "selection": [168], "operator": [169], "(LASSO)": [170], "regression": [171, 238], "model": [172, 239], "demonstrated": [173, 240], "best": [175, 242], "overall": [176, 243], "performance": [177, 244], "on": [178], "hold-out": [180], "set": [182], "area": [185], "under": [186], "receiver": [188], "operating": [189], "characteristic": [190], "curve": [191], "0.92": [193], "(95%": [194, 202, 211, 221], "CI,": [195, 203, 212, 222], "0.89": [196], "0.94),": [198], "accuracy": [199], "83%": [201], "80%": [204], "87%),": [206], "calibration": [207, 217], "intercept": [208], "\u20130.06": [210], "\u20130.14": [213], "0.01),": [215], "slope": [218], "1.06": [220], "0.95": [223], "1.17).": [225], "CONCLUSION": [226], "Among": [227], "various": [228], "techniques,": [230], "combined": [234], "LASSO": [237], "extracting": [246], "outcomes": [248], "This": [253], "provides": [255], "framework": [257], "development": [260], "machine": [262], "learning-based": [263], "well": [267], "vignette": [271], "metastases.": [277]}, "authors": ["Joeky T.

A variety of natural language processing (NLP) methods have emerged to automate the processing of free text ranging from statistical to deep learning\u2013based models; however, the optimal approach for medical text analysis remains to be determined. The aim of this study was to provide a head-to-head comparison of novel NLP techniques and inform future studies about their utility for automated medical text analysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS Magnetic resonance imaging reports of patients with brain metastases treated in two tertiary centers were retrieved and manually annotated using a binary classification (single metastasis v two or more metastases). Multiple bag-of-words and sequence-based NLP models were developed and compared after randomly splitting the annotated reports into training and test sets in an 80:20 ratio. RESULTS A total of 1,479 radiology reports of patients diagnosed with brain metastases were retrieved. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model demonstrated the best overall performance on the hold-out test set with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.89 to 0.94), accuracy of 83% (95% CI, 80% to 87%), calibration intercept of \u20130.06 (95% CI, \u20130.14 to 0.01), and calibration slope of 1.06 (95% CI, 0.95 to 1.17). CONCLUSION Among various NLP techniques, the bag-of-words approach combined with a LASSO regression model demonstrated the best overall performance in extracting binary outcomes from free-text clinical reports. This study provides a framework for the development of machine learning-based NLP models as well as a clinical vignette of patients diagnosed with brain metastases."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W1997386208", "relevance_score": 166.83246, "publication_year": 2014, "title": "Usefulness of urinary CTX-II and NTX-I in evaluating radiological knee osteoarthritis : the Matsudai knee osteoarthritis survey", "cited_by_count": 28, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Osteoarthritis", "level": 3, "score": 0.84118813}, {"display_name": "N-terminal telopeptide", "level": 5, "score": 0.6094901}, {"display_name": "Rheumatology", "level": 2, "score": 0.5009377}, {"display_name": "Urinary system", "level": 2, "score": 0.49587616}, {"display_name": "Internal medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.48856625}, {"display_name": "Quartile", "level": 3, "score": 0.45660168}, {"display_name": "Physical therapy", "level": 1, "score": 0.35386395}, {"display_name": "Urology", "level": 1, "score": 0.32600883}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"To": [0], "assess": [1], "the": [2, 5, 34, 37, 99, 122, 128, 132, 139, 142, 152, 156, 162, 166, 170, 186, 194, 207, 217, 225, 238, 245], "usefulness": [3], "of": [4, 9, 17, 36, 77, 89, 141, 164, 169, 179, 200, 209, 228], "urinary": [6], "crosslinked": [7, 15], "C-telopeptide": [8], "type": [10, 18], "II": [11], "collagen": [12, 20], "(uCTX-II)": [13], "or": [14, 73], "N-telopeptide": [16], "I": [19], "(uNTX-I)": [21], "for": [22], "evaluating": [23], "radiological": [24, 93], "knee": [25, 39, 50, 94, 143, 210, 246], "osteoarthritis": [26, 40], "(OA),": [27], "a": [28, 104, 203], "crosssectional": [29], "study": [30, 235], "was": [31, 96, 149, 219], "conducted": [32], "in": [33, 43, 98, 155, 185, 197, 212, 224, 249], "cohorts": [35], "Matsudai": [38], "survey": [41], "performed": [42], "Niigata,": [44], "Japan.": [45], "Urine": [46], "specimens": [47], "and": [48, 67, 79, 172], "standing": [49], "AP": [51], "X-rays": [52], "were": [53, 84], "obtained": [54], "from": [55], "1040": [56], "subjects": [57, 102, 184], "who": [58], "provided": [59], "informed": [60], "consent.": [61], "The": [62, 86, 107, 191], "relationship": [63], "between": [64, 151], "these": [65], "markers": [66], "gender,": [68], "age": [69, 252], "(patients": [70], "aged": [71], "40-59": [72], "60-79": [74], "years),": [75], "use": [76], "bisphosphonates,": [78], "OA": [80, 95, 112, 124, 144, 158, 183, 211, 247], "grades": [81], "(K\u2013L": [82], "classification)": [83], "analyzed.": [85], "diagnostic": [87], "ability": [88], "uCTX-II": [90, 119, 133, 171, 201, 239], "to": [91, 138, 221, 259], "detect": [92], "confirmed": [97], "over": [100, 108, 129, 187, 251], "60-year-old": [101, 109, 130], "using": [103], "ROC": [105, 198], "curve.": [106], "men": [110], "with": [111, 206, 244], "grade": [113, 125, 159, 180, 248], "3,4": [114], "group": [115], "had": [116], "significantly": [117, 135], "higher": [118, 167, 177], "levels": [120, 134, 154, 174], "than": [121], "other": [123], "groups.": [126, 160], "In": [127], "women,": [131], "increased": [136], "according": [137], "progression": [140], "grade.": [145], "No": [146], "significant": [147, 204], "difference": [148], "observed": [150], "uNTX-I": [153, 173], "different": [157], "From": [161], "standpoint": [163], "biomarkers,": [165], "quartiles": [168], "gradually": [175], "included": [176], "numbers": [178], "\u2265": [181], "2": [182], "60": [188], "year-old": [189], "women.": [190], "area": [192], "under": [193], "curve": [195], "(AUC)": [196], "analysis": [199, 256], "exhibited": [202], "association": [205], "diagnosis": [208], "women": [213, 250], "(AUC": [214], "0.63),": [215], "although": [216], "accuracy": [218], "evaluated": [220], "be": [222], "low": [223], "single": [226], "measurement": [227], "our": [229], "health": [230], "checkup-based": [231], "analysis.": [232], "This": [233], "population-based": [234], "indicates": [236], "that": [237], "level": [240], "is": [241, 257], "strongly": [242], "correlated": [243], "60.": [253], "A": [254], "further": [255], "needed": [258], "clarify": [260], "its": [261], "predictive": [262], "accuracy.": [263]}, "authors": ["N.

Urine specimens and standing knee AP X-rays were obtained from 1040 subjects who provided informed consent. The relationship between these markers and gender, age (patients aged 40-59 or 60-79 years), use of bisphosphonates, and OA grades (K\u2013L classification) were analyzed. The diagnostic ability of uCTX-II to detect radiological knee OA was confirmed in the over 60-year-old subjects using a ROC curve. The over 60-year-old men with OA grade 3,4 group had significantly higher uCTX-II levels than the other OA grade groups. In the over 60-year-old women, the uCTX-II levels significantly increased according to the progression of the knee OA grade. No significant difference was observed between the uNTX-I levels in the different OA grade groups. From the standpoint of biomarkers, the higher quartiles of the uCTX-II and uNTX-I levels gradually included higher numbers of grade \u2265 2 OA subjects in the over 60 year-old women. The area under the curve (AUC) in ROC analysis of uCTX-II exhibited a significant association with the diagnosis of knee OA in women (AUC 0.63), although the accuracy was evaluated to be low in the single measurement of our health checkup-based analysis.

Median tissue stiffness at the cortex (22.6 kPa [ interquartile range 18.8\u201325.7 kPa] vs 22.3 kP a [interquartile range 19.0\u201326.5 kP a], P = 0.70) and medulla (15.0 kP a [interquartile range 13.7\u201318.0 kPa] vs 15.6 kP a [interquartile range 14.4\u201318.2 kP a]) showed no significant differences between the two observers. Interobserver agreement was satisfactory (intraclass correlation coefficient of the cortex 0.84, 95% CI 0.70\u20130.92 and intraclass correlation coefficient of the medulla 0.88, 95% CI 0.78\u20130.94). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for detection of tubulointerstitial fibrosis were estimated to be 0.75 (95% CI 0.61\u20130.89), 0.85 (95% CI 0.75\u20130.95) and 0.65 (95% CI 0.53\u20130.78) for cortical, medullary tissue stiffness and serum creatinine, respectively. Conclusions Shear wave elastography can be used as a non\u2010invasive tool to evaluate kidney allograft fibrosis with reasonable interobserver agreement and superior test performance to serum creatinine in detecting early tubulointerstitial fibrosis."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2043224900", "relevance_score": 164.70158, "publication_year": 2014, "title": "Clinical and radiological outcomes following arthroscopic-assisted management of tibial plateau fractures: a systematic review", "cited_by_count": 28, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Radiological weapon", "level": 2, "score": 0.8590015}, {"display_name": "Arthroscopy", "level": 2, "score": 0.63655853}, {"display_name": "Osteoarthritis", "level": 3, "score": 0.55708444}, {"display_name": "Surgery", "level": 1, "score": 0.5382035}, {"display_name": "Percutaneous", "level": 2, "score": 0.5192297}, {"display_name": "Retrospective cohort study", "level": 2, "score": 0.45940676}, {"display_name": "MEDLINE", "level": 2, "score": 0.4489927}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"To": [0], "carry": [1], "out": [2], "a": [3, 20, 38], "systematic": [4, 210], "review": [5, 211], "of": [6, 14, 24, 44, 59, 92, 103, 107, 125, 144, 170, 184, 193, 208, 216], "the": [7, 42, 60, 101, 121, 145, 166, 180], "literature": [8], "on": [9], "arthroscopic-assisted": [10, 214], "management": [11, 43, 215], "(all": [12], "types)": [13], "tibial": [15, 45, 63, 76, 217, 233], "plateau": [16, 46, 77, 218, 234], "fractures": [17, 219], "to": [18, 32, 161, 204], "gain": [19], "more": [21], "comprehensive": [22], "understanding": [23], "clinical": [25, 80, 95, 155, 174], "outcomes": [26, 83], "with": [27, 75, 232], "this": [28, 35, 209, 227], "surgical": [29], "technique,": [30], "specifically": [31], "determine": [33], "whether": [34], "may": [36], "be": [37, 221], "viable": [39], "technique": [40], "for": [41], "fractures.MEDLINE,": [47], "Cochrane,": [48], "and": [49, 66, 79, 81, 96, 100, 112, 151], "EMBASE": [50], "databases": [51], "were": [52, 71, 94, 118], "searched": [53], "until": [54], "July": [55], "2013": [56], "using": [57, 85, 226], "combinations": [58], "search": [61], "terms:": [62], "plateau,": [64], "fractures,": [65, 78], "arthroscopically/arthroscopic/arthroscopy/percutaneous/minimally": [67], "invasive.": [68], "Inclusion": [69], "criteria": [70], "observational": [72], "study,": [73, 165, 179], "patients": [74, 117, 126, 171, 185, 194, 231], "radiological": [82, 97, 188], "assessed": [84], "Rasmussen": [86, 98, 156, 175, 189], "scoring": [87], "system.": [88], "The": [89, 123, 135, 142, 191], "outcome": [90], "measures": [91], "interest": [93], "scores": [99, 157], "prevalence": [102], "secondary": [104, 197], "osteoarthritis.A": [105], "total": [106], "12": [108], "studies,": [109], "5": [110], "prospective": [111], "7": [113], "retrospective,": [114], "involving": [115], "353": [116], "included": [119], "in": [120, 127], "review.": [122], "majority": [124, 167, 181], "most": [128], "studies": [129], "had": [130, 172, 186], "Schatzker": [131], "type": [132], "I-III": [133], "fractures.": [134], "graft": [136], "material": [137], "used": [138], "varied": [139], "between": [140, 149], "studies.": [141], "length": [143], "follow-up": [146], "was": [147, 199], "typically": [148], "34": [150], "38": [152], "months.": [153], "Mean": [154], "ranged": [158], "from": [159, 202], "25.5": [160], "28.4.": [162], "In": [163, 177], "each": [164, 178], "(\u226580": [168], "%)": [169, 183], "excellent/good": [173, 187], "scores.": [176, 190], "(\u226563": [182], "proportion": [192], "who": [195], "experienced": [196], "osteoarthritis": [198], "variable,": [200], "ranging": [201], "0": [203], "47.6": [205], "%.The": [206], "results": [207], "indicate": [212], "that": [213], "can": [220], "effective.": [222], "Surgeons": [223], "should": [224], "consider": [225], "approach": [228], "when": [229], "treating": [230], "fractures.III.": [235]}, "authors": ["Hongwei Chen", "Guodong Liu", "Lijun Wu"], "abstract": "To carry out a systematic review of the literature on arthroscopic-assisted management (all types) of tibial plateau fractures to gain a more comprehensive understanding of clinical outcomes with this surgical technique, specifically to determine whether this may be a viable technique for the management of tibial plateau fractures.MEDLINE, Cochrane, and EMBASE databases were searched until July 2013 using combinations of the search terms: tibial plateau, fractures, and arthroscopically/arthroscopic/arthroscopy/percutaneous/minimally invasive. Inclusion criteria were observational study, patients with tibial plateau fractures, and clinical and radiological outcomes assessed using Rasmussen scoring system. The outcome measures of interest were clinical and radiological Rasmussen scores and the prevalence of secondary osteoarthritis.A total of 12 studies, 5 prospective and 7 retrospective, involving 353 patients were included in the review. The majority of patients in most studies had Schatzker type I-III fractures. The graft material used varied between studies. The length of the follow-up was typically between 34 and 38 months. Mean clinical Rasmussen scores ranged from 25.5 to 28.4. In each study, the majority (\u226580 %) of patients had excellent/good clinical Rasmussen scores. In each study, the majority (\u226563 %) of patients had excellent/good radiological Rasmussen scores.

To evaluate the 2-year outcomes of open-door cervical laminoplasty with prophylactic bilateral C4\u2013C5 foraminotomy. Summary of Background Data. A prospective trial of prophylactic bilateral C4\u2013C5 foraminotomy with open-door laminoplasty for cervical compression myelopathy showed a significant efficacy for preventing postoperative C5 palsy. However, in bilateral foraminotomy, there are concerns such as postoperative instability, hinge fracture, or nonunion, which may cause deterioration of neurological symptoms and neck pain. Methods. A prospective trial was performed in 141 patients between 2009 and 2010 (group F). A group of 141 patients who underwent open-door laminoplasty without prophylactic foraminotomy from 2006 to 2008 served as a control group (group NF). Here, we report 2-year radiological and clinical data for 121 patients (follow-up rate: 85.8%) in group F and 115 patients (81.6%) in group NF. The 2 groups were demographically similar, except for the operation time. Results. In group F, the mean rate of facet joint preservation was 71.4%. C2\u2013C7 and C4\u2013C5 lordosis and C4 translational movement were maintained postoperatively in both groups. The range of motion of C2\u2013C7 and C4\u2013C5 significantly decreased to about 80% of the preoperative values in both groups (P < 0.01). These radiological parameters and the incidence of hinge fracture and nonunion did not differ significantly between the groups. Visual analogue scale scores for neck pain were unchanged and significant recoveries (P < 0.001) in Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores were found in both groups. There were no significant differences in these clinical scores between the groups. The incidences of C5 palsy were 1.7% and 7.0% in groups F and NF, respectively (P = 0.043). Conclusion. Prophylactic bilateral C4\u2013C5 foraminotomy did not adversely affect the 2-year radiological and clinical outcomes. Therefore, we conclude that this approach is an effective and desirable procedure for preventing postoperative C5 palsy. Level of Evidence: 3 The 2-year outcome of open-door laminoplasty with prophylactic bilateral C4\u2013C5 foraminotomy for cervical myelopathy was evaluated.

Despite successful cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), some patients recur. Currently there are no guidelines on the methods, frequency and intensity of follow-up. Methods Between 1994 and 2016, 1070 patients underwent surgery for a perforated epithelial tumour of the appendix, predominantly with PMP. Overall (OS) and Disease Free Survival (DFS) were documented by annual CT scanning and evaluated according to the Kaplan-Meier method. The influence of histological differentiation was investigated. Results Overall, 775/1070 (72%) had complete cytoreductive surgery (CCRS) and HIPEC. Histological classification was low grade PMP in 615 (79.4%), high grade PMP in 134 (17.3%) and adenocarcinoma in 26 (3.4%). DFS and OS were significantly worse for high grade disease, with the steepest decline for both in the first three years. DFS curves, for low as well as high grade PMP, levelled off at year 6 at approximately 60% and 20% respectively. Thereafter there were few recurrences in either group. Conclusion Annual CT of the abdomen and pelvis in the first six years appears to be adequate follow-up for low grade PMP. In high grade PMP, additional imaging of the chest and more frequent surveillance, during the first three years postoperatively, may detect recurrent disease earlier. From year 6 on, reduced frequency of follow-up is proposed, independent of the histology. This long-term follow-up in a large number of patients gives insight into tumour behavior after CCRS and HIPEC for PMP and guides intensity of surveillance."}, {"id":

Although deep learning (DL) using brain MRI with certain image biomarkers has shown satisfactory results in predicting poor outcomes, no study has assessed the usefulness of natural language processing (NLP)-based machine learning (ML) algorithms using brain MRI free-text reports of AIS patients. Therefore, we aimed to assess whether NLP-based ML algorithms using brain MRI text reports could predict poor outcomes in AIS patients. This study included only English text reports of brain MRIs examined during admission of AIS patients. Poor outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 3\u20136, and the data were captured by trained nurses and physicians. We only included MRI text report of the first MRI scan during the admission. The text dataset was randomly divided into a training and test dataset with a 7:3 ratio. Text was vectorized to word, sentence, and document levels. In the word level approach, which did not consider the sequence of words, and the \u201cbag-of-words\u201d model was used to reflect the number of repetitions of text token. The \u201csent2vec\u201d method was used in the sensation-level approach considering the sequence of words, and the word embedding was used in the document level approach. In addition to conventional ML algorithms, DL algorithms such as the convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory, and multilayer perceptron were used to predict poor outcomes using 5-fold cross-validation and grid search techniques. The performance of each ML classifier was compared with the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve. Among 1840 subjects with AIS, 645 patients (35.1%) had a poor outcome 3 months after the stroke onset. Random forest was the best classifier (0.782 of AUROC) using a word-level approach. Overall, the document-level approach exhibited better performance than did the word- or sentence-level approaches. Among all the ML classifiers, the multi-CNN algorithm demonstrated the best classification performance (0.805), followed by the CNN (0.799) algorithm. When predicting future clinical outcomes using NLP-based ML of radiology free-text reports of brain MRI, DL algorithms showed superior performance over the other ML algorithms. In particular, the prediction of poor outcomes in document-level NLP DL was improved more by multi-CNN and CNN than by recurrent neural network-based algorithms. NLP-based DL algorithms can be used as an important digital marker for unstructured electronic health record data DL prediction."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W4362522726", "relevance_score":

However, textual radiological reports also contain relevant information for determining the likelihood of presenting radiological signs of COVID-19 involving lungs. The development of COVID-19 automatic detection systems based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques could provide a great help in supporting clinicians and detecting COVID-19 related disorders within radiological reports. In this paper we propose a text classification system based on the integration of different information sources. The system can be used to automatically predict whether or not a patient has radiological findings consistent with COVID-19 on the basis of radiological reports of chest CT. To carry out our experiments we use 295 radiological reports from chest CT studies provided by the \u2018\u2018HT m\u00e9dica\" clinic. All of them are radiological requests with suspicions of chest involvement by COVID-19. In order to train our text classification system we apply Machine Learning approaches and Named Entity Recognition. The system takes two sources of information as input: the text of the radiological report and COVID-19 related disorders extracted from SNOMED-CT. The best system is trained using SVM and the baseline results achieve 85% accuracy predicting lung involvement by COVID-19, which already offers competitive values that are difficult to overcome. Moreover, we apply mutual information in order to integrate the best quality information extracted from SNOMED-CT. In this way, we achieve around 90% accuracy improving the baseline results by 5 points."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2107544267", "relevance_score": 282.70477, "publication_year": 2011, "title":

Materials and methods Two observers (O1 and O2) twice independently classified 52 shoulder radiographs into the cuff arthropathy schemes of Favard, Visotsky-Seebauer, Hamada, and Sirveaux. The schemes of Samilson and Prieto as well as Kellgren and Lawrence, commonly used for osteoarthritis of the shoulder, were also used for comparison. Reliability was tested with the \u03ba coefficient. Results The intraobserver and interobserver reliabilities were 0.812 for O1, 0.710 for O2, and 0.305 for O1 versus O2 for the Favard classification; 0.868, 0.583, and 0.551, respectively, for the Visotsky-Seebauer classification; 1.000, 0.491, and 0.407, respectively, for the Hamada classification; and 0.852, 0.602, and 0.598, respectively, for the Sirveaux classification.

Discussion Of the classification schemes tested, the Sirveaux classification displayed the best reliability overall. The Sirveaux classification only respects alterations of the glenoid, however.

The aim of our study was to develop a reliable and clinically useful classification system for this condition in children. Methods The case notes and radiographs of 87 children with chronic hematogenous osteomyelitis of one or more long bone were reviewed to devise a classification system. We undertook reliability studies of the proposed classification system. Five observers classified the selected radiographs of 32 patients on two separate occasions. Results The classification divides the condition into 3 main types: type A\u2014Brodie's abscess, type B\u2014sequestrum involucrum, and type C\u2014sclerotic. Type B has four subtypes. Intraobserver agreement was 95% for the main types and 77% (\u03ba coefficient 0.7) with the subtypes. Interobserver agreement was 95% to 97% for the main types and 78% (multirater \u03ba=0.54) for the subtypes.

Materials and Methods Twenty students enrolled in an elective entitled \u201cIntroduction to Clinical Radiology.\u201d Students were divided into groups of two or three and given a case file describing the hospital visit of a patient with a common computed tomographic (CT) diagnosis. Files contained a PowerPoint presentation with all images from the patient\u2019s CT examination (allowing students to scroll through the images as if viewed on a picture archive and communication system workstation), as well as emergency department records, admission and discharge summaries, surgical notes, pathology reports, and radiology reports. Group discussion was facilitated by radiology staff acting as consultants, rather than instructors. As a final project, each group presented its case to the students and faculty. Results Compared with before the course, students\u2019 understanding of the role of radiologists in the clinical management of patients significantly increased, but interest in radiology as a specialty was unchanged. Students significantly preferred scrolling through images on their own, rather than being shown static images in a didactic format. Students significantly agreed that they would recommend the course to a classmate.

In spinal cord injury without radiologic abnormalities (SCIWORA), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect intramedullary or extramedullary pathologies or show absence of neuroimaging abnormalities. However, the prognostic and therapeutic consequences of specific MRI patterns are unclear. A comprehensive systematic literature search was performed to examine patient characteristics and imaging patterns of pediatric SCIWORA and to evaluate the prognostic value of a MRI-based classification system. METHODS MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Google Scholar were searched for studies on SCIWORA in children. Inclusion criteria were (1) traumatic spinal cord injury with acute neurologic deficit, (2) absence of fractures and/or dislocations of the spine, and (3) an immature skeleton or age of less than 18 years. MRI patterns and clinical course were correlated. RESULTS Forty articles reporting 114 patients were identified. At admission, neurologic deficit assessed by the American Spinal Injury Association impairment scale was A in 28%, B in 17%, C in 31%, and D in 25%. At final follow-up, these were 19%, 6%, 10%, and 16%, respectively. In 43%, no MRI abnormalities (Type I) were detected, and 57% exhibited abnormal scan results (Type II): 6% revealed extraneural (Type IIa), 38% intraneural (Type IIb), and 13% combined abnormalities (Type IIc). At admission and follow-up, American Spinal Injury Association impairment scale differed significantly between the imaging types. CONCLUSION This systematic review emphasizes the prognostic value of spinal MRI for children with SCIWORA. It highlights the role of the MRI classification system in improving the comparability and interpretability. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Systematic review, level IV.

Although nucleic acid testing of SARS-CoV-2 is still the gold standard for diagnosis, there are well-recognized early-detection problems including time-consuming in the diagnosis process, noticeable false-negative rate in the early stage and lacking nucleic acid testing kits in some areas. Therefore, effective and rational applications of imaging technologies are critical in aiding the screen and helping the diagnosis of suspected patients. Currently, chest computed tomography is recommended as the first-line imaging test for detecting COVID-19 pneumonia, which could allow not only early detection of the typical chest manifestations, but also timely estimation of the disease severity and therapeutic effects. In addition, other radiological methods including chest X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission computed tomography also show significant advantages in the detection of COVID-19 pneumonia.

A prospective study was performed of all cases of diagnosed orbital lymphomas. Data on patient demographics, symptoms and clinical findings, histological type of lymphoma, site of lesion, imaging, and systemic involvement were recorded in each case. The mean age of the enrolled 20 patients was 63.65 years. Most orbital lymphomas were located in the superior-lateral quadrant. Superior rectus muscle was the most frequently involved orbital structure. Most patients were affected by extranodal marginal-zone lymphomas. The diagnosis of orbital lymphomas may be challenging, because these neoplasms present few specific features. Although not typically performed by the maxillofacial surgeon, an understanding of the staging process is crucial for multidisciplinary management of orbital lymphomas."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W3117383848", "relevance_score": 211.96469, "publication_year": 2020, "title": "Analysis of Stroke Detection during the COVID-19 Pandemic Using Natural Language Processing of Radiology Reports", "cited_by_count": 27, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Neuroimaging", "level": 2, "score": 0.72844446}, {"display_name": "Generalizability theory", "level": 2, "score": 0.6083578}, {"display_name": "Stroke (engine)", "level": 2, "score": 0.47444546}, {"display_name": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)", "level": 4, "score": 0.44749236}, {"display_name": "Pandemic", "level": 5, "score": 0.43498275}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.43036243}, {"display_name": "Magnetic resonance imaging", "level": 2, "score": 0.42627752}, {"display_name": "Pathology", "level": 1, "score": 0.33304912}, {"display_name": "Disease", "level": 2, "score": 0.31128782}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"The": [0, 233], "coronavirus": [1], "disease": [2], "2019": [3], "(COVID-19)": [4], "pandemic": [5, 34], "has": [6], "led": [7], "to": [8, 16, 61, 68, 162, 189, 226, 297], "decreases": [9], "in": [10, 20, 81, 149, 173, 199, 228], "neuroimaging": [11, 212, 250], "volume.": [12], "Our": [13], "aim": [14], "was": [15, 107, 157], "quantify": [17], "the": [18, 33, 160, 163, 194, 207, 253], "change": [19], "acute": [21, 76, 144, 176, 214, 268, 281], "or": [22, 29, 77, 145, 177, 184, 215, 243, 269, 282], "subacute": [23, 78, 146, 178, 216, 244, 270, 283], "ischemic": [24, 79, 147, 179, 217, 245, 271, 284], "strokes": [25, 148, 180], "detected": [26, 248], "on": [27, 182, 240], "CT": [28, 183], "MR": [30, 185], "imaging": [31, 111, 186], "during": [32, 224, 252], "using": [35, 93, 109], "natural": [36, 89, 117, 234], "language": [37, 90, 103, 118, 235, 274], "processing": [38, 91, 104, 119, 236, 275], "of": [39, 127, 133, 140, 143, 260], "radiology": [40, 45, 97], "reports.We": [41], "retrospectively": [42], "analyzed": [43], "32,555": [44], "reports": [46, 98, 112], "from": [47, 52, 58, 66, 113, 187, 196, 222], "brain": [48], "CTs": [49], "and": [50, 129], "MRIs": [51], "a": [53, 86, 122, 136, 257], "comprehensive": [54], "stroke": [55, 80, 218, 246, 264, 285], "center,": [56], "performed": [57, 238], "March": [59, 188], "1": [60], "April": [62, 190], "30": [63], "each": [64], "year": [65, 156], "2017": [67], "2020,": [69], "involving": [70], "20,414": [71], "unique": [72], "patients.": [73], "To": [74], "detect": [75], "free-text": [82], "reports,": [83], "we": [84, 167], "trained": [85], "random": [87], "forest": [88], "classifier": [92, 105, 120, 161, 237, 292], "1987": [94], "randomly": [95], "sampled": [96], "with": [99, 135, 175, 193, 203, 213], "manual": [100], "annotation.": [101], "Natural": [102, 273], "generalizability": [106], "evaluated": [108], "1974": [110], "an": [114, 130, 169], "external": [115, 241], "dataset.The": [116], "achieved": [121], "5-fold": [123], "cross-validation": [124, 152], "classification": [125], "accuracy": [126], "0.97": [128], "F1": [131], "score": [132], "0.74,": [134], "slight": [137], "underestimation": [138], "(-5%)": [139], "actual": [141], "numbers": [142, 286], "cross-validation.": [150], "Importantly,": [151], "performance": [153], "stratified": [154], "by": [155, 249], "similar.": [158], "Applying": [159], "complete": [164], "study": [165], "cohort,": [166], "found": [168], "estimated": [170, 208], "24%": [171], "decrease": [172], "patients": [174, 202], "reported": [181], "2020": [191, 229], "compared": [192], "average": [195], "those": [197], "months": [198], "2017-2019.": [200], "Among": [201], "stroke-related": [204], "order": [205], "indications,": [206], "proportion": [209, 259], "who": [210], "underwent": [211], "detection": [219], "significantly": [220], "increased": [221], "16%": [223], "2017-2019": [225], "21%": [227], "(P": [230], "=": [231], ".01).": [232], "worse": [239], "data.Acute": [242], "cases": [247], "decreased": [251], "COVID-19": [254], "pandemic,": [255], "though": [256, 290], "higher": [258], "studies": [261], "ordered": [262], "for": [263, 267, 287], "were": [265], "positive": [266], "strokes.": [272], "approaches": [276], "can": [277], "help": [278], "automatically": [279], "track": [280], "epidemiologic": [288], "studies,": [289], "local": [291], "training": [293], "is": [294], "important": [295], "due": [296], "radiologist": [298], "reporting": [299], "style": [300], "differences.": [301]}, "authors": ["Manfei Li", "Min Lang", "Francis Deng", "Ken Chang", "Karen Buch", "Sandra Rincon", "William A.

Our aim was to quantify the change in acute or subacute ischemic strokes detected on CT or MR imaging during the pandemic using natural language processing of radiology reports.We retrospectively analyzed 32,555 radiology reports from brain CTs and MRIs from a comprehensive stroke center, performed from March 1 to April 30 each year from 2017 to 2020, involving 20,414 unique patients. To detect acute or subacute ischemic stroke in free-text reports, we trained a random forest natural language processing classifier using 1987 randomly sampled radiology reports with manual annotation. Natural language processing classifier generalizability was evaluated using 1974 imaging reports from an external dataset.The natural language processing classifier achieved a 5-fold cross-validation classification accuracy of 0.97 and an F1 score of 0.74, with a slight underestimation (-5%) of actual numbers of acute or subacute ischemic strokes in cross-validation. Importantly, cross-validation performance stratified by year was similar. Applying the classifier to the complete study cohort, we found an estimated 24% decrease in patients with acute or subacute ischemic strokes reported on CT or MR imaging from March to April 2020 compared with the average from those months in 2017-2019. Among patients with stroke-related order indications, the estimated proportion who underwent neuroimaging with acute or subacute ischemic stroke detection significantly increased from 16% during 2017-2019 to 21% in 2020 (P = .01). The natural language processing classifier performed worse on external data.Acute or subacute ischemic stroke cases detected by neuroimaging decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, though a higher proportion of studies ordered for stroke were positive for acute or subacute ischemic strokes. Natural language processing approaches can help automatically track acute or subacute ischemic stroke numbers for epidemiologic studies, though local classifier training is important due to

jugular bulb (HJB) have limitations, such as focusing simply on the incidence or having a relatively small number of subjects. The objective of this article was to investigate the overall incidence of HJB and bony dehiscence in HJB on a large scale using high-resolution temporal bone computed tomography. The other purpose was to measure the horizontal distance from the tympanic annulus and the height above the annulus. The next step was to classify HJBs according to relative levels compared with surrounding structures.Temporal bone computed tomographic images from January 2005 to April 2010 at Pusan National University Hospital, a tertiary care center, were reviewed retrospectively. Exclusion criteria were patients younger than 10 years, a previously operated ear, cholesteatoma with bony destruction, adhesive otitis media with unclear position of tympanic membrane, and congenital anomalies of the ear. We investigated the incidence of HJB, the bony dehiscence of the HJB, horizontal distance, vertical height of HJB, and classified HJB in relation to neighboring structures. We used the cochlear basal turn and the lateral semicircular canal as criteria for classification because they were readily seen in most cases: group A, above the inferior bony annulus of the tympanic membrane and below the cochlear basal turn; group B, above the cochlear basal turn and below the lateral semicircular canal; and group C, above the lateral semicircular canal.Total 2,299 cases (4,598 ears) were finally examined. The study group consisted of 1025 male and 1,274 female patients, aged 11 to 90 years (mean, 48.0 yr). Of the 2,299 patients, 298 (13.0%) had HJB. HJB was observed in 435 (9.5%) of 4598 ears. HJB was more prominent on the right (right:left = 1.88:1; p < 0.01). Of the 435 HJB cases, 121 (27.8%) had bony dehiscence. HJB with bony dehiscence also was more prominent on the right (right:left = 2.03:1; p < 0.01). The average horizontal distance between HJB and the inferior bony annulus of the tympanic membrane was 2.2 \u00b1 1.8 mm. HJB in contact with the tympanic membrane was seen in 47 ears (47/435, 10.8%).

Successful breast conservation relies on understanding key elements for patient selection, evaluation, treatment contraindications, radiation therapy methods, and integration with systemic therapy.The Appropriateness Criteria Committee of the American College of Radiology convened an expert panel to examine BCT for early-stage breast cancer. By using a modified Delphi technique to generate consensus, the expert panel responded to questionnaires on 9 clinical cases that address various key elements of breast conservation. A literature review on BCT led to the generation of an evidence table to support the consensus and overview.Consensus for appropriateness criteria for BCT was produced for various clinical scenarios commonly encountered in practice. These topics include radiation oncology management issues related to young patient age, sentinel node biopsy, elderly patients, other histology, positive margins, extensive intraductal component, node-positive breast cancer, genetic breast cancer, partial breast irradiation, and systemic therapy. Radiation methods for BCT are reviewed.The Breast Cancer Panel has generated a consensus of up-to-date guidelines for the appropriate use of radiation for BCT by using a modified Delphi process for the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2100128090", "relevance_score": 204.30234, "publication_year": 2009, "title": "Radiologic Signs in Thoracic Imaging:<i>Case-Based Review and Self-Assessment Module</i>", "cited_by_count": 27, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.6132784}, {"display_name": "Medical physics", "level": 1, "score": 0.47423455}, {"display_name": "Signs and symptoms", "level": 2, "score": 0.4399708}, {"display_name": "Medical imaging", "level": 2, "score": 0.41962916}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Chest": [0], "imaging": [1, 17], "remains": [2], "one": [3], "of": [4, 9, 15, 24, 31, 56, 68, 71], "the": [5, 20, 25, 45, 66, 72], "most": [6], "complicated": [7], "sub-specialties": [8], "diagnostic": [10], "radiology.": [11], "The": [12], "successful": [13], "interpretation": [14], "thoracic": [16, 58], "studies": [18], "requires": [19], "recognition": [21], "and": [22, 50], "understanding": [23, 55], "radiologic": [26, 59], "signs": [27, 60], "that": [28, 61], "are": [29, 43, 62], "characteristic": [30], "many": [32], "complex": [33], "disease": [34], "processes.The": [35], "educational": [36], "objectives": [37], "for": [38, 44], "this": [39], "case-based": [40], "self-assessment": [41], "module": [42], "participant": [46], "to": [47], "exercise,": [48], "self-assess,": [49], "improve": [51], "his": [52], "or": [53], "her": [54], "important": [57], "useful": [63], "in": [64], "establishing": [65], "diagnosis": [67], "particular": [69], "diseases": [70], "chest.": [73]}, "authors": ["Mark S.

Martin"], "abstract": "Programmes to manage patient dose in radiology are becoming a higher priority as the number of imaging examinations and the proportion of higher dose computed tomography (CT) and complex interventional procedures all continue to rise. Such programmes have a number of components and their implementation in UK hospitals, which have been developing such programmes over two decades, is described. As part of any programme to manage patient doses, elements should be in place for both justification and optimisation. The system for justification needs to be robust in order to minimise the number of unnecessary procedures and requires the provision of training in radiation protection for medical and other staff to ensure that they understand the risks. Optimisation of X-ray techniques requires performance tests on equipment at installation and regularly thereafter, linked to surveys of patient doses. Confirming the performance of the available options on fluoroscopy and CT equipment is essential and the information obtained should be available to radiographers and radiologists, so they can make informed choices in developing imaging protocols. Patient doses should be compared with diagnostic reference levels set in terms of measured dose quantities to allow the identification of equipment that is giving higher doses. Taking the next step of analysing results to determine the reasons for high doses is crucial and requires a link with the equipment performance tests and an understanding of the underlying physics. Medical physics services play an important role at the hub of the dose management programme for carrying out tests, organising surveys, making recommendations on optimisation strategies and training other staff in radiation protection, performance testing and dose reduction. Programmes for management of patient doses in UK hospitals were first set up in the late 1980s by medical physicists and have been developed since that time to keep pace with the developments in technology. Regional departments serving several hundred or a thousand X-ray units form the model followed in most regions. This paper describes the form of patient dose management programmes in the UK. It also gives guidance that might be useful to others that are now embarking on the same journey."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2037410245", "relevance_score": 196.90775, "publication_year": 2011, "title": "Informing Patients About Risks and Benefits of Radiology Examinations: A Review Article", "cited_by_count": 27, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Comprehension", "level": 2, "score": 0.6339469}, {"display_name": "Liability", "level": 2, "score": 0.5688535}, {"display_name": "Terminology", "level": 2, "score": 0.52034163}, {"display_name": "Apprehension", "level": 2, "score": 0.5190364}, {"display_name": "Population", "level": 2, "score": 0.511297}, {"display_name": "Intervention (counseling)", "level": 2, "score": 0.5082604}, {"display_name": "Medical terminology", "level": 2, "score": 0.47335148}, {"display_name": "Informed consent", "level": 3, "score": 0.45791522}, {"display_name": "Health care", "level": 2, "score": 0.4401226}, {"display_name": "Autonomy", "level": 2, "score": 0.43616816}, {"display_name": "Medical education", "level": 1, "score": 0.38175198}, {"display_name": "Nursing", "level": 1, "score": 0.35730207}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Communicating": [0, 135], "the": [1, 39, 60, 67, 89, 105, 111, 122, 136, 174, 195, 202, 224, 240, 246, 257], "risks,": [2, 137], "benefits,": [3, 138], "and": [4, 28, 63, 69, 80, 114, 120, 127, 139, 163, 198, 204, 215, 249, 255, 262], "alternatives": [5, 140], "to": [6, 13, 38, 131, 141, 148, 173, 266], "a": [7, 55, 108, 142, 190, 243], "planned": [8, 143], "medical": [9, 35, 44, 72, 144, 170, 179, 207], "intervention": [10, 145], "is": [11, 54, 75, 85, 146, 189, 210, 220], "integral": [12, 147], "high-quality": [14, 149], "patient": [15, 22, 26, 150, 157, 161], "care.": [16, 151], "When": [17, 152], "effective,": [18, 153], "such": [19, 154], "communication": [20, 45, 155, 180], "promotes": [21, 156], "autonomy,": [23, 158], "alleviates": [24, 159], "unfounded": [25, 160], "apprehension,": [27, 162], "mitigates": [29, 164], "medicolegal": [30, 165], "liability.": [31, 166], "The": [32, 167], "topic": [33, 168], "of": [34, 42, 49, 57, 66, 71, 82, 97, 117, 169, 177, 184, 192, 201, 206, 217, 232, 252], "radiation": [36, 171], "adds": [37, 172], "usual": [40, 175], "challenges": [41, 48, 176, 183], "effective": [43, 178], "some": [46, 181], "special": [47, 182], "its": [50, 185], "own.": [51, 186], "Among": [52, 187], "these": [53, 188], "lack": [56, 191], "understanding": [58, 193], "by": [59, 77, 88, 194, 212, 223], "general": [61, 196], "population": [62, 197], "health": [64, 199], "professionals": [65, 200], "benefits": [68, 203], "risks": [70, 205], "radiation,": [73, 208], "which": [74, 209], "compounded": [76, 211], "unfamiliar": [78, 213], "terminology": [79, 214], "units": [81, 216], "measure.": [83, 218], "This": [84, 219], "further": [86, 128, 221, 263], "complicated": [87, 222], "fact": [90, 225], "that": [91, 226], "many": [92, 227], "patients": [93, 228], "have": [94, 229], "poor": [95, 230], "comprehension": [96, 231], "risk": [98, 233], "data": [99, 234], "in": [100, 235], "general.": [101, 236], "In": [102, 237], "this": [103, 132, 238, 267], "article,": [104, 239], "authors": [106, 241], "present": [107, 242], "case,": [109, 244], "review": [110, 245], "ethical": [112, 247], "basis": [113, 248], "legal": [115, 250], "history": [116, 251], "informed": [118, 253], "consent,": [119, 254], "explore": [121, 256], "current": [123, 258], "initiatives,": [124, 259], "available": [125, 260], "resources,": [126, 261], "opportunities": [129, 264], "related": [130, 265], "challenging": [133, 268], "topic.": [134, 269]}, "authors": ["Jeremy S.

The introduction of digital imaging systems, picture archiving and communication systems (PACS), and teleradiology transformed radiology services over the past 30 years. Radiology is again at the crossroad for the next generation of transformation, possibly evolving as a one-stop integrated diagnostic service. Artificial intelligence and machine learning promise to offer radiology new powerful new digital tools to facilitate the next transformation. The radiology community has been developing computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools based on machine learning (ML) over the past 20 years. Among various AI techniques, deep-learning convolutional neural networks (CNN) and its variants have been widely used in medical image pattern recognition. Since the 1990s, many CAD tools and products have been developed. However, clinical adoption has been slow due to a lack of substantial clinical advantages, difficulties integrating into existing workflow, and uncertain business models. This paper proposes three pathways for AI's role in radiology beyond current CNN based capabilities 1) improve the performance of CAD, 2) improve the productivity of radiology service by AI-assisted workflow, and 3) develop radiomics that integrate the data from radiology, pathology, and genomics to facilitate the emergence of a new integrated diagnostic service."}, {"id":

In radiotherapy, irradiation of lymphatic paths relevant to the localisation of the primary has been common practice for decades. Similarly, excision of cancer is often completed by lymphatic dissection. Both in radiotherapy and in surgery, advanced knowledge of the lymphatic pathways relevant to any tumour location is an important information for treatment preparation and execution. This second part describes the lymphatics of the upper limb, of the thorax and of the upper abdomen.

Spinal cord tumors are uncommon, and approximately 2%\u20133% of primary intra-axial tumors of the central nervous system occur in the spinal cord. Primary intra-axial tumors are usually derived from neuroepithelial tissue, especially glial cells. This often leads to a classic intramedullary mass differential diagnosis of ependymoma or astrocytoma, which together constitute up to 70% of spinal cord tumors. For example, ependymomas occur predominantly in adults, and astrocytomas (specifically pilocytic astrocytomas) occur predominantly in children. While that is an excellent starting point, in order to refine the differential diagnosis, the authors review the radiologic-pathologic features of specific neoplastic categories and entities recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the 2016 WHO Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System and a few additional congenital-developmental entities. Radiologists can add value by providing a reasonable preoperative differential diagnosis for the patient and neurosurgeon, in many cases by favoring the most common conditions, and in other cases by identifying radiologic features that may point toward a less common entity. Some of the less common entities include intramedullary myxopapillary ependymoma, spinal subependymoma, and spinal hemangioblastoma. Whenever possible, the characteristic imaging features and locations of these tumors are explained or traced back to the underlying cell of origin and findings seen at histopathologic examination.

Methods A HIPAA-compliant, institutional review board\u2013exempt review of two years (January 2013 to December 2014) of discrepancy data was retrospectively performed for total number of examination interpreted, discrepancy rates, resident training level, and discrepancy categories. Most common diagnoses and means of results communication for discharged patients were also recorded. Results Radiology residents interpreted 153,420 examinations after hours and had 2169 discrepancies, for an overall discrepancy rate of 1.4%. Discrepancy rates for postgraduate year (PGY)-3, PGY-4, and PGY-5 residents were 1.31%, 1.65%, and 1.88%, respectively. The rate of critical discrepancies was extremely low (10/153,420 or 0.007%). A total of 502 patients (23.2% of all discrepancies) were discharged at the time their discrepancy was identified, 60% of whom had non-time-dependent discrepancies that were communicated by radiologists; 32.4% of these had addended results telephoned to a PCP, 43.4% had addended results telephoned to the patient, and the remaining 24.2% required a registered letter. Eight percent of patients with non-time-dependent findings were lost to follow-up. Conclusions Our resident discrepancy rates were comparable to those published previously, with extremely low rates of critical discrepancies. Radiologists assumed responsibility for contacting the majority of discharged patients with discrepant results, a minority of whom were lost to follow-up."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2541712823", "relevance_score": 190.66533, "publication_year": 2016, "title": "Meaningful Peer Review in Radiology: A Review of Current Practices and Potential Future Directions", "cited_by_count": 27, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Adjudication", "level": 2, "score": 0.556014}, {"display_name": "Quality (philosophy)", "level": 2, "score": 0.47565004}, {"display_name": "Best practice", "level": 2, "score": 0.4716655}, {"display_name": "Technical peer review", "level": 3, "score": 0.46129167}, {"display_name": "Peer review", "level": 2, "score": 0.4217009}, {"display_name": "Medical physics", "level": 1, "score": 0.39629585}, {"display_name": "Data science", "level": 1, "score": 0.36640465}, {"display_name": "Risk analysis (engineering)", "level": 1, "score": 0.33548883}, {"display_name": "Medical education", "level": 1, "score": 0.3336726}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"The": [0, 38, 74], "current": [1, 26, 133], "practice": [2], "of": [3, 40, 71, 77, 100], "peer": [4, 27, 42, 78, 126, 140], "review": [5, 28, 79, 127, 141], "within": [6], "radiology": [7], "is": [8], "well": [9], "developed": [10], "and": [11, 34, 56, 61, 69, 86, 98, 104, 110, 135], "widely": [12], "implemented": [13], "compared": [14], "with": [15, 117, 129], "other": [16, 111], "medical": [17], "specialties.": [18], "However,": [19], "there": [20], "are": [21], "many": [22], "factors": [23], "that": [24, 65, 113], "limit": [25], "practices": [29], "from": [30, 48], "reducing": [31], "diagnostic": [32, 72], "errors": [33], "improving": [35], "patient": [36], "care.": [37], "development": [39], "\"meaningful": [41], "review\"": [43], "requires": [44, 80], "a": [45], "transition": [46], "away": [47], "compliance": [49], "toward": [50], "quality": [51], "improvement,": [52], "whereby": [53], "the": [54, 67, 122], "information": [55], "insights": [57], "gained": [58], "facilitate": [59], "education": [60], "drive": [62], "systematic": [63], "improvements": [64, 82], "reduce": [66], "frequency": [68], "impact": [70], "error.": [73], "next": [75], "generation": [76], "significant": [81], "in": [83, 142], "IT": [84], "functionality": [85], "integration,": [87], "enabling": [88], "features": [89], "such": [90], "as": [91], "anonymization,": [92], "adjudication": [93], "by": [94], "multiple": [95], "specialists,": [96], "categorization": [97], "analysis": [99], "errors,": [101], "tracking,": [102], "feedback,": [103], "easy": [105], "export": [106], "into": [107], "teaching": [108], "files": [109], "media": [112], "require": [114], "strong": [115], "partnerships": [116], "vendors.": [118], "In": [119], "this": [120], "article,": [121], "authors": [123], "assess": [124], "various": [125], "practices,": [128], "focused": [130], "discussion": [131], "on": [132], "limitations": [134], "future": [136], "needs": [137], "for": [138], "meaningful": [139], "radiology.": [143]}, "authors": ["Andrew K.

In this article, the authors assess various peer review practices, with focused discussion on current limitations and future needs for meaningful peer review in radiology."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2164957281", "relevance_score": 189.502, "publication_year": 2007, "title": "Radiological and functional changes over 3 years in young children with cystic fibrosis", "cited_by_count": 27, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Spirometry", "level": 3, "score": 0.850065}, {"display_name": "Cystic fibrosis", "level": 2, "score": 0.74499655}, {"display_name": "Chest radiograph", "level": 3, "score": 0.6587638}, {"display_name": "Vital capacity", "level": 5, "score": 0.5351387}, {"display_name": "Pediatrics", "level": 1, "score": 0.51583356}, {"display_name": "Radiography", "level": 2, "score": 0.51137847}, {"display_name": "Radiological weapon", "level": 2, "score": 0.49545324}, {"display_name": "Lung volumes", "level": 3, "score": 0.49151048}, {"display_name": "Asthma", "level": 2, "score": 0.47409186}, {"display_name": "Lung", "level": 2, "score": 0.32138553}, {"display_name": "Internal medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.30538994}, {"display_name": "Lung function", "level": 3, "score": 0.27246067}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.22659624}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"The": [0], "aim": [1], "of": [2, 94, 161], "the": [3, 87, 103, 117, 131, 139, 151, 168], "present": [4], "study": [5, 169], "was": [6, 82, 113, 145], "to": [7], "evaluate": [8], "airway": [9], "disease": [10], "progression": [11], "assessed": [12, 83], "by": [13], "chest": [14, 34, 179], "radiology,": [15], "expiratory": [16, 153], "interrupter": [17], "resistance": [18], "(Rint,exp)": [19], "and": [20, 55, 73, 86, 106, 125, 136, 138], "spirometry": [21], "in": [22, 47, 84, 120, 142, 155, 173], "young": [23, 174], "children": [24, 50, 175], "with": [25, 37, 43, 58, 176], "cystic": [26, 177], "fibrosis": [27], "(CF)": [28], "over": [29, 102, 184], "a": [30, 44, 92, 107, 159], "3-yr": [31, 45, 104], "period.": [32, 170], "Two": [33], "radiographs": [35, 64], "combined": [36], "two": [38], "R(int,exp)": [39], "measurements": [40, 75], "were": [41, 65, 76, 89], "performed": [42], "interval": [46], "21": [48], "preschool": [49, 121, 124], "(age": [51, 60], "(mean+/-sd)": [52], "3.2+/-0.9": [53], "yrs)": [54], "30": [56], "schoolchildren": [57, 85, 126], "CF": [59, 70], "7.2+/-1.9": [61], "yrs).": [62], "Chest": [63, 97], "scored": [66], "using": [67], "five": [68], "different": [69], "scoring": [71], "systems": [72], "Rint,exp": [74, 128, 143], "expressed": [77, 90], "as": [78, 91, 158], "height-adjusted": [79], "Z-scores.": [80], "Spirometry": [81], "results": [88], "percentage": [93, 160], "predicted": [95], "values.": [96], "radiograph": [98, 180], "scores": [99, 181], "worsened": [100], "significantly": [101, 166, 183], "period": [105], "tendency": [108], "towards": [109], "more": [110], "pronounced": [111], "changes": [112], "observed,": [114], "especially": [115], "for": [116], "Wisconsin": [118], "score,": [119], "children.": [122], "Most": [123], "had": [127], "Z-scores": [129], "within": [130], "normal": [132], "range": [133], "at": [134], "start": [135], "follow-up,": [137], "annual": [140], "change": [141], "Z-score": [144], "not": [146], "significant.": [147], "In": [148, 171], "schoolchildren,": [149], "only": [150], "forced": [152, 162], "volume": [154], "one": [156], "second": [157], "vital": [163], "capacity": [164], "declined": [165], "during": [167], "summary,": [172], "fibrosis,": [178], "worsen": [182], "time": [185], "even": [186], "while": [187], "lung": [188], "function": [189], "remains": [190], "stable.": [191]}, "authors": ["Suzanne W.

Chest radiographs were scored using five different CF scoring systems and Rint,exp measurements were expressed as height-adjusted Z-scores. Spirometry was assessed in schoolchildren and the results were expressed as a percentage of predicted values. Chest radiograph scores worsened significantly over the 3-yr period and a tendency towards more pronounced changes was observed, especially for the Wisconsin score, in preschool children. Most preschool and schoolchildren had Rint,exp Z-scores within the normal range at start and follow-up, and the annual change in Rint,exp Z-score was not significant. In schoolchildren, only the forced expiratory volume in one second as a percentage of forced vital capacity declined significantly during the study period. In summary, in young children with cystic fibrosis, chest radiograph scores worsen significantly over time even while lung function remains stable."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2048436037", "relevance_score": 188.59654, "publication_year": 2012, "title": "Diffusion tensor imaging demonstrated radiologic differences between diplegic and quadriplegic cerebral palsy", "cited_by_count": 27, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Diffusion MRI", "level": 3, "score": 0.8325901}, {"display_name": "Cerebral palsy", "level": 2, "score": 0.8086046}, {"display_name": "Fractional anisotropy", "level": 4, "score": 0.8082285}, {"display_name": "Corticospinal tract", "level": 4, "score": 0.7409637}, {"display_name": "Effective diffusion coefficient", "level": 3, "score": 0.52729154}, {"display_name": "Nuclear medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.47490394}, {"display_name": "Magnetic resonance imaging", "level": 2, "score": 0.37805787}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.28811002}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Little": [0], "information": [1], "is": [2], "available": [3], "on": [4], "the": [5, 10, 20, 46, 76, 86, 97, 115, 127, 144, 149, 156, 179], "use": [6], "of": [7, 12, 45, 50, 96, 114, 117, 126, 148, 155, 181], "imaging": [8, 43], "for": [9, 143], "classification": [11], "cerebral": [13, 25, 30, 56, 184], "palsy": [14, 26, 31, 57, 185], "patients.": [15, 186], "The": [16, 122, 152], "present": [17], "study": [18], "examined": [19], "radiological": [21], "differences": [22], "between": [23], "quadriplegic": [24], "patients": [27, 32, 58], "(QCP),": [28], "diplegic": [29], "(DCP)": [33], "and": [34, 52, 63, 75, 90, 102, 109, 119, 160], "normal": [35], "control": [36], "subjects": [37], "(NC)": [38], "by": [39], "performing": [40], "diffusion": [41, 92], "tensor": [42], "(DTI)": [44], "corticospinal": [47], "tract": [48], "(CST)": [49], "upper": [51, 118, 150], "lower": [53, 120, 128], "extremities.": [54, 121, 151], "Twenty-three": [55], "(11": [59], "QCP,": [60], "12": [61, 64], "DCP)": [62], "NC": [65], "were": [66, 69, 79, 132], "enrolled.": [67], "DTI": [68, 153, 169], "scanned": [70], "using": [71, 81], "a": [72, 173], "1.5": [73], "T": [74], "CST": [77, 157, 182], "images": [78], "analyzed": [80], "FMRIB": [82], "software.": [83], "We": [84], "measured": [85], "fractional": [87], "anisotropy": [88], "(FA)": [89], "apparent": [91], "coefficient": [93], "(ADC)": [94], "values": [95, 113, 125], "CST.": [98], "Compared": [99], "to": [100, 136, 177], "DCP": [101, 131, 161], "NC,": [103], "QCP": [104, 159], "had": [105], "decreased": [106], "mean": [107, 111, 123, 145], "FA": [108, 124, 146], "increased": [110], "ADC": [112], "CSTs": [116], "extremities": [129], "in": [130, 158, 183], "significantly": [133, 162], "decreased,": [134], "compared": [135], "NC;": [137], "however": [138], "this": [139], "was": [140], "not": [141], "observed": [142], "value": [147], "results": [154], "corresponded": [163], "with": [164], "their": [165], "typical": [166], "clinical": [167], "manifestation.": [168], "may": [170], "thus": [171], "be": [172], "very": [174], "powerful": [175], "modality": [176], "assess": [178], "state": [180]}, "authors": ["Hee Jin Lee", "Sung Ho Jang", "Sang Seok Yoe", "Eunsil Lee", "Saeyoon Kim", "Dong Gyu Lee", "Su Min Son"], "abstract": "Little information is available on the use of imaging for the classification of cerebral palsy patients.

Twenty-three cerebral palsy patients (11 QCP, 12 DCP) and 12 NC were enrolled. DTI were scanned using a 1.5 T and the CST images were analyzed using FMRIB software. We measured the fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the CST. Compared to DCP and NC, QCP had decreased mean FA and increased mean ADC values of the CSTs of upper and lower extremities. The mean FA values of the lower extremities in DCP were significantly decreased, compared to NC; however this was not observed for the mean FA value of the upper extremities. The DTI results of the CST in QCP and DCP significantly corresponded with their typical clinical manifestation.

Second, we analyzed the usefulness of the ellipsoid method in pituitary adenoma volume determination.Two-hundred and ninety-four pituitary adenomas, which were surgically treated in our department, were retrospectively analyzed. Age, gender, surgical approach, hormonal status, greater tumor diameter, volume, cavernous sinus invasion, and extent of resection were evaluated.One-hundred and forty-eight surgical procedures were conducted with a microsurgical transsphenoidal approach whereas 146 were conducted with an endoscopic endonasal approach. Gross total resection was achieved in 54.08% of cases. There were no significant differences in the extent of resection regarding the approach used, age, gender, or hormonal production by the tumor. Only Knosp grade (P < 0.001) and tumor volume (P < 0.05) had a statistically and independent significant relationship with the extent of resection. Furthermore, we found a high correlation between the calculated volume, using the ellipsoid method, and the volume measurement obtained with complex planimetry methods.Pituitary adenoma volume and cavernous sinus invasion, graded with the Knosp scale, are 2 pituitary tumor features that, when used in combination, predict the complexity of the surgery and the difficulty of achieving gross total resection in pituitary adenoma surgery."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2150687839", "relevance_score": 181.84314, "publication_year": 1995, "title": "A study of radiologic imaging techniques and airway grading to predict a difficult endotracheal intubation", "cited_by_count": 27, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Radiography", "level": 2, "score": 0.77417254}, {"display_name": "Intubation", "level": 2, "score": 0.76155025}, {"display_name": "Airway", "level": 2, "score": 0.67930025}, {"display_name": "Soft tissue", "level": 2, "score": 0.6467186}, {"display_name": "Magnetic resonance imaging", "level": 2, "score": 0.63174826}, {"display_name": "Laryngoscopy", "level": 3, "score": 0.62838227}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.61211586}, {"display_name": "Endotracheal intubation", "level": 3, "score": 0.53551024}, {"display_name": "Chest radiograph", "level": 3, "score": 0.51382285}, {"display_name": "Airway management", "level": 3, "score": 0.49406436}, {"display_name": "Grading (engineering)", "level": 2, "score": 0.4755228}, {"display_name": "Anesthesia", "level": 1, "score": 0.4148183}, {"display_name": "Tracheal intubation", "level": 3, "score": 0.41057995}, {"display_name": "Nuclear medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.3720653}, {"display_name": "Surgery", "level": 1, "score": 0.34093013}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"To": [0], "study": [1, 47, 125], "whether": [2, 26], "a": [3, 41, 61, 83, 127, 219, 227], "detailed": [4], "radiographic": [5, 146], "examination": [6], "of": [7, 64, 86, 135, 159, 179], "neck": [8, 137], "and": [9, 45, 57, 82, 120, 131, 166, 182, 203], "upper": [10], "airway": [11, 181], "can": [12, 36], "help": [13], "identify": [14], "normal": [15], "looking": [16], "patients": [17, 65, 72, 88, 96], "in": [18, 40, 60, 73, 89, 106, 157], "whom": [19, 74, 90, 107], "endotracheal": [20, 67, 78, 91, 229], "intubation": [21, 79, 92], "may": [22], "be": [23, 38, 238], "difficult;": [24], "determine": [25], "such": [27], "parameters": [28, 143, 162], "as": [29], "identified": [30, 39, 98, 239], "by": [31, 216], "magnetic": [32], "resonance": [33], "imaging": [34], "(MRI)": [35], "also": [37], "soft": [42, 128, 167, 204, 241], "tissue": [43, 129, 168, 205, 242], "radiograph;": [44], "to": [46, 100], "the": [48, 108, 136, 154, 175, 180, 183, 192, 234], "correlation": [49, 221], "between": [50, 153, 174, 233], "oropharyngeal": [51, 121], "appearance,": [52], "based": [53], "on": [54, 163, 240], "Mallampati's": [55], "classification,": [56], "laryngoscopic": [58], "findings": [59, 224], "large": [62], "number": [63], "requiring": [66], "intubation.Prospective.University": [68], "medical": [69], "center.20": [70], "adult": [71], "an": [75, 132], "unanticipated": [76], "difficult": [77, 228], "was": [80, 93, 110], "encountered,": [81], "control": [84], "group": [85], "20": [87, 158], "easily": [94, 111], "accomplished.Difficult-to-intubate": [95], "were": [97, 113, 138, 149, 207], "according": [99], "prospectively": [101], "established": [102], "criteria.": [103], "Control": [104], "subjects,": [105], "trachea": [109], "intubated,": [112], "matched": [114], "for": [115], "age,": [116], "gender,": [117], "height,": [118], "weight,": [119], "appearance.In": [122], "all": [123], "40": [124], "patients,": [126], "radiograph": [130], "MRI": [133, 164, 189, 202, 245], "scan": [134], "obtained.": [139], "We": [140], "measured": [141, 161], "21": [142, 160], "from": [144, 188, 201], "both": [145], "studies.": [147], "There": [148], "no": [150], "significant": [151, 231], "differences": [152], "two": [155, 193, 235], "groups": [156, 194, 236], "scans": [165, 190], "radiographs.": [169], "Only": [170], "one": [171], "measurement--the": [172], "distance": [173], "uppermost": [176], "visible": [177], "part": [178], "posterior": [184], "pharyngeal": [185], "wall": [186], "(measured": [187], "only)--between": [191], "achieved": [195], "statistical": [196], "significance.": [197], "The": [198], "values": [199], "recorded": [200], "radiographs": [206], "not": [208], "significantly": [209], "different.": [210], "Airway": [211], "grading": [212], "system": [213], "first": [214], "suggested": [215], "Mallampati": [217], "had": [218], "fair": [220], "with": [222, 226], "laryngoscopy": [223], "associated": [225], "intubation.No": [230], "difference": [232], "could": [237], "radiography": [243], "or": [244], "scans.": [246]}, "authors": ["Satwant K.

Control subjects, in whom the trachea was easily intubated, were matched for age, gender, height, weight, and oropharyngeal appearance.In all 40 study patients, a soft tissue radiograph and an MRI scan of the neck were obtained. We measured 21 parameters from both radiographic studies. There were no significant differences between the two groups in 20 of 21 measured parameters on MRI scans and soft tissue radiographs. Only one measurement--the distance between the uppermost visible part of the airway and the posterior pharyngeal wall (measured from MRI scans only)--between the two groups achieved statistical significance. The values recorded from MRI and soft tissue radiographs were not significantly different. Airway grading system first suggested by Mallampati had a fair correlation with laryngoscopy findings associated with a difficult endotracheal intubation.No significant difference between the two

"authors": ["Nida Mushtaq", "Kendrick To", "Chris Gooding", "Wasim Khan"], "abstract": "Total hip arthroplasties (THA) have been performed in the UK from the 1960s and since then we have seen surgical techniques, the design of implants and imaging modalities rapidly develop. This paper will aim to review the different complications and imaging appearance which help to evaluate each problem. As for all initial bone and joint investigations, a radiograph is the first imaging to be performed for any patient with a total hip replacement and can detect a majority of complications. CT is relatively inexpensive, readily available and easy to perform making it an excellent tool to supplement radiographs when trying to evaluate a hip prosthesis. Single photon emission computed tomography with CT (SPECT-CT) is an emerging diagnostic modality which has shown to combine the sensitivity that bone scintigraphy offers with the high specificity of CT. SPECT imaging has the advantage of showing the metabolic activity of the bone surrounding the prosthesis and is less prone than MRI to metal artefact. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has evolved to become an important diagnostic tool for the evaluation of hip arthroplasty in the post-operative period. Optimised pulse sequences and metal artefact reduction techniques have made MRI a useful tool in diagnosis of periprosthetic fractures, bone resorption and osteolysis, soft tissue reactions and neurovascular compromise. CT and MRI are accurate in identifying the diagnosis of most causes of hip arthroplasty complications except infection. Research confirms that leukocyte/marrow imaging is the modality of choice for accurately diagnosing prosthetic joint infection and reassures us of its superiority over other nuclear medicine imaging. Ultrasound (US) is not recommended as the first line examination to assess peri-prosthetic bone complications due to the deep location of the hip prosthesis and the inability of the sound to penetrate bone or metal. However, US still has a role in identifying peri-prosthetic fluid collections and the presence of sinus tracts within soft tissues. We conclude that although imaging is not performed by orthopaedic surgeons, an understanding of the radiological appearances of these complications along with the advantages and disadvantages of each modality will ensure optimal patient care."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2554874464", "relevance_score": 162.93239, "publication_year": 2016, "title": "Clinical and genetic association, radiological findings and response to biological therapy in seven children from Qatar with non-bacterial osteomyelitis", "cited_by_count": 27, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis", "level": 4, "score": 0.94415075}, {"display_name": "Canakinumab", "level": 4, "score": 0.80678856}, {"display_name": "Osteomyelitis", "level": 2, "score": 0.7381369}, {"display_name": "Infliximab", "level": 3, "score": 0.7326613}, {"display_name": "MEFV", "level": 5, "score": 0.6448227}, {"display_name": "Genetic testing", "level": 2, "score": 0.50367635}, {"display_name": "Compound heterozygosity", "level": 4, "score": 0.49462506}, {"display_name": "Anakinra", "level": 3, "score": 0.4649405}, {"display_name": "Retrospective cohort study", "level": 2, "score": 0.43888244}, {"display_name": "Magnetic resonance imaging", "level": 2, "score": 0.43696105}, {"display_name": "Internal medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.4171836}, {"display_name": "Pediatrics", "level": 1, "score": 0.38935176}, {"display_name": "Surgery", "level": 1, "score": 0.3726412}, {"display_name": "Osteitis", "level": 3, "score": 0.26424748}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.20404127}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"We": [0], "aim": [1], "to": [2, 168], "report": [3], "the": [4, 19, 135, 161], "clinical": [5], "manifestations,": [6], "genetic": [7, 213], "testing": [8, 94, 214], "results,": [9], "magnetic": [10], "resonance": [11], "imaging": [12], "(MRI)": [13], "findings": [14], "and": [15, 51, 56, 80, 88, 117, 143, 157, 160, 181, 188, 193, 212, 224, 231], "biologics": [16], "used": [17], "in": [18, 24, 102, 110, 125, 153, 220], "management": [20], "of": [21, 31, 65, 122, 186], "non-bacterial": [22, 48, 53], "osteomyelitis": [23, 45, 49, 199], "our": [25], "center.We": [26], "conducted": [27], "a": [28, 60, 105, 208, 217], "retrospective": [29], "review": [30], "medical": [32], "records.": [33], "A": [34], "previously": [35], "proposed": [36], "classification": [37], "was": [38, 163, 194], "implemented": [39], "as": [40], "follows:": [41], "chronic": [42, 47], "recurrent": [43], "multifocal": [44], "(CRMO),": [46], "(CNBO)": [50], "acute": [52], "osteomyelitis.Four": [54], "females": [55], "three": [57], "males": [58], "with": [59, 72, 113, 178, 197, 202, 228], "median": [61], "age": [62], "at": [63], "presentation": [64], "6": [66], "years": [67, 167], "(6": [68], "months-14": [69], "years)": [70], "presented": [71], "arthralgia": [73], "(7/7),": [74], "back": [75], "pain": [76, 82], "(4/7),": [77], "arthritis": [78], "(4/7)": [79, 142], "bone": [81], "(2/7).": [83], "Six": [84], "patients": [85, 148, 172], "had": [86, 91, 190], "CRMO": [87], "one": [89, 111, 126, 189], "patient": [90, 112, 177], "CNBO.": [92], "Genetic": [93], "revealed": [95], "an": [96], "apparent": [97], "homozygote": [98], "p.S734L": [99], "LPIN2": [100], "mutation": [101, 109], "two": [103], "siblings,": [104], "heterozygote": [106, 118], "p.M694V": [107], "MEFV": [108], "familial": [114], "Mediterranean": [115], "fever": [116], "p.Q219H": [119], "PSTPIPI": [120], "variant": [121], "unknown": [123], "significance": [124], "patient.": [127], "The": [128], "most": [129], "common": [130], "lesions": [131], "on": [132], "MRI": [133, 206], "involved": [134], "tibia": [136], "(6/7),": [137], "talar": [138], "bones": [139], "(5/7),": [140], "fibula": [141], "sacroiliac": [144], "joints": [145], "(4/7).": [146], "Three": [147], "received": [149, 173], "infliximab.": [150], "Two": [151, 170], "are": [152, 226], "remission": [154], "after": [155, 165], "2": [156], "5": [158, 166], "years,": [159], "third": [162], "advanced": [164], "canakinumab.": [169], "other": [171, 203], "canakinumab": [174, 225], "first.": [175], "One": [176], "Majeed": [179], "syndrome": [180], "dyserythropoietic": [182], "anemia": [183], "exhibited": [184], "evidence": [185], "improvement,": [187], "partial": [191], "improvement": [192], "then": [195], "treated": [196], "infliximab.Non-bacterial": [198], "may": [200, 215, 240], "coexist": [201], "autoinflammatory": [204], "diseases.": [205], "remains": [207], "favorable": [209], "diagnostic": [210], "tool": [211], "have": [216], "limited": [218], "role": [219], "selected": [221], "cases.": [222], "Infliximab": [223], "associated": [227], "variable": [229], "outcomes,": [230], "6-week": [232], "or": [233], "less": [234], "dosing": [235], "intervals": [236], "for": [237], "both": [238], "medications": [239], "be": [241], "more": [242], "effective.": [243]}, "authors": ["Taha Moussa", "Venkatraman Bhat", "Vishwanatha Kini", "Basil M.

The study population comprised 80 patients (four men and 76 women) with a mean age of 70 years (52 to 86) with acute fragility fractures of the distal radius requiring open reduction and internal fixation with a volar locking plate and screws. Two groups of 40 patients each were randomly allocated either to receive once weekly oral ALN administration (35 mg) within a few days after surgery and continued for six months, or oral ALN administration delayed until four months after surgery. Postero-anterior and lateral radiographs of the affected wrist were taken monthly for six months after surgery. No differences between groups was observed with regard to gender (p = 1.0), age (p = 0.916), fracture classification (p = 0.274) or bone mineral density measured at the spine (p = 0.714). The radiographs were assessed by three independent assessors. There were no significant differences in the mean time to complete cortical bridging observed between the ALN group (3.5 months (se 0.16)) and the no-ALN group (3.1 months (se 0.15)) (p = 0.068). All the fractures healed in the both groups by the last follow-up. Improvement of the Quick-Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH) score, grip strength, wrist range of movement, and tenderness over the fracture site did not differ between the groups over the six-month period. Based on our results, early administration of ALN after surgery for distal radius fracture did not appear to delay fracture healing times either radiologically or clinically.

The authors established a proxy for the relative attractiveness (RA) of diagnostic radiology (relative to all specialties) in the match, which was calculated by subtracting the percentage fill rate for all specialties from that for radiology. The RA values were plotted for 1990-2000 and compared with trends in the HWI, American College of Radiology data, and AMA salary data.The RA of diagnostic radiology varied greatly during the past 10 years, with a low in 1996 and a return to its high in recent years. There is a relationship between the RA and economic vitality of diagnostic radiology, with the RA lagging behind the HWI and AMA salary data by 2 years.Medical students appear to have an in-depth understanding of the economic forces at play in the health care job market and incorporate this information into their choice of a specialty."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2198713792",

During this transition, there is the potential for change in recruitment practices and diversity within the candidate pool. Interventional radiology represents one field in which these factors may have been skewed based on gender-specific preferences. This field still remains a male-dominated specialty in comparison with other subspecialties of radiology. However, when comparing female representation in diagnostic radiology with that in interventional radiology, there remains a notable difference, as 12.2% of interventional radiologists are female compared with 27.8% of diagnostic radiologists (1Chapman C.H. Hwang W.T. Both S. Thomas Jr, C.R. Deville C. Current status of diversity by race, hispanic ethnicity, and sex in diagnostic radiology..Radiology. 2014; 270: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Addressing this issue will improve the diversity in our candidate pool. Diversity is thought to improve patient communication and decrease health disparity (2Lightfoote J.B. Fielding J.R. Deville C. et al.Improving diversity, inclusion, and representation in radiology and radiation oncology part 1: why these matter..J Am Coll Radiol. 2014; 11: 673-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).Even though women represent nearly 50% of the medical students in the United States, there are a number of other medical specialties increasing the diversity in their candidate pools. Orthopedic surgery, urology, interventional cardiology, and cardiac electrophysiology are examples of other fields that exhibit a male predominance. In 2006, only 12.4% of orthopedic residents were women. Similar disparities are noted in interventional cardiology, with only 10% female representation (3Capranzano P. Kunadian V. Mauri J. et al.Motivations for and barriers to choosing an interventional cardiology career path: results from the EAPCI Women Committee worldwide survey..EuroIntervention July 8,. 2015; (http://www.pcronline.com/eurointervention/; published online. http://dx.doi.org/10.4244/EIJY15M07_03)Google Scholar).We obtained institutional review board exemption to study the specific concerns and/or gender-specific preferences that influence medical student residency selection for male and female students at our institution. The online survey (Appendix, available online at www.jvir.org) was designed from previous works and consisted of 13 questions of varying format (4Nissim L. Krupinski E. Hunter T. Taljanovic M. Exposure to, understanding of, and interest in interventional radiology in American medical students..Acad Radiol. 2013; 20: 493-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The first sets of questions within the survey were designed to establish the demographics of the group. The survey included subsequent questions in relation to factors considered when selecting a medical specialty, level of interest in interventional radiology, and deterrents from the field. Respondents were also asked to rate their diagnostic and interventional radiology exposure during medical school. Participation was elicited from medical students on a voluntary basis via email with Google Forms with a 1-week reminder. The survey response rate was 14.7%. All preference data were separated from the demographic information for statistical analysis.A total of 94 medical students completed the distributed survey (Table 1). Statistical analysis was performed by Fisher exact test, with a P value of < .05 set to indicate significance. The majority of the respondents described their interventional radiology exposure as minimal or none, in contrast to diagnostic radiology exposure, which was graded as average or above (Table 2, Table 3). The five principal deterring factors for female respondents were radiation exposure, extended work hours, call responsibilities, career length, and male predominance, as opposed to male respondents, for whom the deterring factors were radiation exposure, career length, extended work hours, patient contact, and call responsibilities (Table 4). Regarding family goals, respondents of both genders stated that family goals would influence their selection of a future specialty (Table 5). Overall, more male than female respondents are considering interventional radiology as a future field.Table 1Survey Respondents by Age and GenderAge GroupFemaleMale20\u201325 y34 (63)32 (80)26\u201330 y18 (33)6 (15)31\u201335 y2 (4)1 (2.5)36\u201340 y01 (2.5)Total54 (57)40 (43)Note\u2013Values in parentheses are percentages.

Open table in a new tab These data suggest that radiation exposure is the main reason why female medical students do not pursue interventional radiology, and, interestingly, this reason is mirrored in their male counterparts. This also remains an issue for interventional cardiology, deterring female students from pursuit of this field and even refocusing their careers in favor of minimal radiation exposure\u2013related procedures after training (3Capranzano P. Kunadian V. Mauri J. et al.Motivations for and barriers to choosing an interventional cardiology career path: results from the EAPCI Women Committee worldwide survey..EuroIntervention July 8,. 2015; (http://www.pcronline.com/eurointervention/; published online. http://dx.doi.org/10.4244/EIJY15M07_03)Google Scholar). Radiation exposure is a concern not only for medical students, but for the radiology community as a whole. Interventional radiologists can play a vital role in communicating these occupational hazards of radiation exposure and principles of radiation safety to medical students.When comparing deterring factors between female and male respondents, the two significant gender differences were call responsibilities and male predominance of the field (P = .02). These two factors can be used to tailor recruitment in the future and address medical student concerns before they apply. Other less significant and expected deterrents among both genders were extended work hours and the length of training. Early exposure and exposure to varied types of interventional practices may be helpful for those who have concerns about time commitment and training length (4Nissim L. Krupinski E. Hunter T. Taljanovic M. Exposure to, understanding of, and interest in interventional radiology in American medical students..Acad Radiol. 2013; 20: 493-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Pairing female medical students with female interventionalists as mentors locally within institutions or geographic regions can also help foster interest and commitment to the field. Increasing recruitment and diversity in interventional radiology interest groups at the medical-school level is a key component in the growth of the field as this new pathway progresses. The SIR, particularly the Resident and Fellow Section, has provided resources for the initiation of interest groups and campaigns to increase enrollment.The limitations of our preliminary study include the small sample size, low response rate, and single-institution protocol. Our low response rate may denote an underrepresentation of our selected population. The failure to separate medical school year within the survey criteria may confound our results. Delineating the medical school year could have served as a reference point to stratify exposure during the basic science to clinical years. Future research examining these factors and others would be beneficial.Recently, the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions Women Initiative announced the creation of a Female Interventional Cardiologists Committee within the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions to achieve gender equality in their field (3Capranzano P. Kunadian V. Mauri J. et al.Motivations for and barriers to choosing an interventional cardiology career path: results from the EAPCI Women Committee worldwide survey..EuroIntervention July 8,. 2015; (http://www.pcronline.com/eurointervention/; published online. http://dx.doi.org/10.4244/EIJY15M07_03)Google Scholar). It is important to note that SIR has recognized these issues, and, within the past decade, initiated a Women in Interventional Radiology Committee. This committee reunites every year at the SIR Annual Meeting to address specific issues. These efforts highlight the Society\u2019s recognition and response at the leadership levels. In the upcoming years, interventional radiology will be transitioning from a subspecialty of radiology to a specialty with its own residency, recruiting applicants directly from medical school. During this transition, there is the potential for change in recruitment practices and diversity within the candidate pool. Interventional radiology represents one field in which these factors may have been skewed based on gender-specific preferences. This field still remains a male-dominated specialty in comparison with other subspecialties of radiology. However, when comparing female representation in diagnostic radiology with that in interventional radiology, there remains a notable difference, as 12.2% of interventional radiologists are female compared with 27.8% of diagnostic radiologists (1Chapman C.H. Hwang W.T. Both S. Thomas Jr, C.R. Deville C. Current status of diversity by race, hispanic ethnicity, and sex in diagnostic radiology..Radiology. 2014; 270: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Addressing this issue will improve the diversity in our candidate pool. Diversity is thought to improve patient communication and decrease health disparity (2Lightfoote J.B. Fielding J.R. Deville C. et al.Improving diversity, inclusion, and representation in radiology and radiation oncology part 1: why these matter..J Am Coll Radiol. 2014; 11: 673-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Even though women represent nearly 50% of the medical students in the United States, there are a number of other medical specialties increasing the diversity in their candidate pools. Orthopedic surgery, urology, interventional cardiology, and cardiac electrophysiology are examples of other fields that exhibit a male predominance. In 2006, only 12.4% of orthopedic residents were women. Similar disparities are noted in interventional cardiology, with only 10% female representation (3Capranzano P. Kunadian V. Mauri J. et al.Motivations for and barriers to choosing an interventional cardiology career path: results from the EAPCI Women Committee worldwide survey..EuroIntervention July 8,. 2015; (http://www.pcronline.com/eurointervention/; published online. http://dx.doi.org/10.4244/EIJY15M07_03)Google Scholar). We obtained institutional review board exemption to study the specific concerns and/or gender-specific preferences that influence medical student residency selection for male and female students at our institution. The online survey (Appendix, available online at www.jvir.org) was designed from previous works and consisted of 13 questions of varying format (4Nissim L. Krupinski E. Hunter T. Taljanovic M. Exposure to, understanding of, and interest in interventional radiology in American medical students..Acad Radiol. 2013; 20: 493-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The first sets of questions within the survey were designed to establish the demographics of the group. The survey included subsequent questions in relation to factors considered when selecting a medical specialty, level of interest in interventional radiology, and deterrents from the field. Respondents were also asked to rate their diagnostic and interventional radiology exposure during medical school. Participation was elicited from medical students on a voluntary basis via email with Google Forms with a 1-week reminder. The survey response rate was 14.7%. All preference data were separated from the demographic information for statistical analysis. A total of 94 medical students completed the distributed survey (Table 1). Statistical analysis was performed by Fisher exact test, with a P value of < .05 set to indicate significance. The majority of the respondents described their interventional radiology exposure as minimal or none, in contrast to diagnostic radiology exposure, which was graded as average or above (Table 2, Table 3). The five principal deterring factors for female respondents were radiation exposure, extended work hours, call responsibilities, career length, and male predominance, as opposed to male respondents, for whom the deterring factors were radiation exposure, career length, extended work hours, patient contact, and call responsibilities (Table 4). Regarding family goals, respondents of both genders stated that family goals would influence their selection of a future specialty (Table 5). Overall, more male than female respondents are considering interventional radiology as a future field. Note\u2013Values in parentheses are percentages. Note\u2013Values in parentheses are percentages. Note\u2013Values in parentheses are percentages. Note\u2013Values in parentheses are percentages. Note\u2013Values in parentheses are percentages. These data suggest that radiation exposure is the main reason why female medical students do not pursue interventional radiology, and, interestingly, this reason is mirrored in their male counterparts. This also remains an issue for interventional cardiology, deterring female students from pursuit of this field and even refocusing their careers in favor of minimal radiation exposure\u2013related procedures after training (3Capranzano P. Kunadian V. Mauri J. et al.Motivations for and barriers to choosing an interventional cardiology career path: results from the EAPCI Women Committee worldwide survey..EuroIntervention July 8,. 2015; (http://www.pcronline.com/eurointervention/; published online. http://dx.doi.org/10.4244/EIJY15M07_03)Google Scholar). Radiation exposure is a concern not only for medical students, but for the radiology community as a whole. Interventional radiologists can play a vital role in communicating these occupational hazards of radiation exposure and principles of radiation safety to medical students. When comparing deterring factors between female and male respondents, the two significant gender differences were call responsibilities and male predominance of the field (P = .02). These two factors can be used to tailor recruitment in the future and address medical student concerns before they apply. Other less significant and expected deterrents among both genders were extended work hours and the length of training. Early exposure and exposure to varied types of interventional practices may be helpful for those who have concerns about time commitment and training length (4Nissim L. Krupinski E. Hunter T. Taljanovic M. Exposure to, understanding of, and interest in interventional radiology in American medical students..Acad Radiol. 2013; 20: 493-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Pairing female medical students with female interventionalists as mentors locally within institutions or geographic regions can also help foster interest and commitment to the field. Increasing recruitment and diversity in interventional radiology interest groups at the medical-school level is a key component in the growth of the field as this new pathway progresses. The SIR, particularly the Resident and Fellow Section, has provided resources for the initiation of interest groups and campaigns to increase enrollment. The limitations of our preliminary study include the small sample size, low response rate, and single-institution protocol. Our low response rate may denote an underrepresentation of our selected population. The failure to separate medical school year within the survey criteria may confound our results. Delineating the medical school year could have served as a reference point to stratify exposure during the basic science to clinical years. Future research examining these factors and others would be beneficial. Recently, the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions Women Initiative announced the creation of a Female Interventional Cardiologists Committee within the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions to achieve gender equality in their field (3Capranzano P. Kunadian V. Mauri J. et al.Motivations for and barriers to choosing an interventional cardiology career path: results from the EAPCI Women Committee worldwide survey..EuroIntervention July 8,. 2015; (http://www.pcronline.com/eurointervention/; published online. http://dx.doi.org/10.4244/EIJY15M07_03)Google Scholar). It is important to note that SIR has recognized these issues, and, within the past decade, initiated a Women in Interventional Radiology Committee. This committee reunites every year at the SIR Annual Meeting to address specific issues. These efforts highlight the Society\u2019s recognition and response at the leadership levels. Appendix.

This is a single-center, multisurgeon, retrospective study of radiologic and functional outcome measures at a minimum 2-year follow-up. Objective. We studied the radiologic and functional outcomes following 3 or more motion segment fusions of the lumbar spine for low back pain due to multilevel degenerative disc disease. Summary of Background Data. Good functional outcomes have been reported for 1 or 2-level fusions, but there are no reports dealing specifically with 3 or more level fusions. Methods. A total of 80 adult patients met the inclusion/exclusion criteria of multilevel (3 or more motion segments) 360\u00b0 fusion for lumbar degenerative disc disease, failed nonoperative treatment for at least 1 year, no previous lumbar fusion, no fracture, tumor or infection of the spine, completed preoperative and postoperative functional questionnaires including SF-36 (n = 80), Oswestry (n = 69), Roland Morris (n = 68), and radiologic evaluation of fusion solidity with a minimum follow-up of 2 years. Results. The average patient age was 57 years (range, 27\u201381). The mean follow-up was 4 years (2\u20137). On average, patients had fusion of 4 motion segments (range, 3\u20138 levels). Solid arthrodesis at the first surgery was achieved in 65/80 (81%). Adjacent segment degeneration was noted in 11 patients. Of these, 5 had undergone an extension of their fusion within the study period. There were no deaths or neurologic complications. Deep wound infection occurred in 2 patients, neither requiring implant removal. The Oswestry Disability Index scores improved from 49.8 to 35.1 (29.5%) (P < 0.001). The Roland Morris scores improved from 17.6 to 12.2 (30.7%) (P < 0.001). For the SF-36 scales, significant (P < 0.001) improvement was seen in all scales except Role Emotional scores and Mental Composite Scales. Conclusion. The surgical treatment of lumbar degenerative disc disease by 360\u00b0 fusion should be considered for properly selected patients. The goal of surgery is reduction, not elimination of disability. Circumferential fusion of 3 or more levels in the lumbar spine for degenerative disc disease was successful based on both radiologic and functional outcome analysis. Patients had significant lessening of their disability, but not elimination of all disability."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2148001089", "relevance_score": 149.75087, "publication_year": 2010,

Generally Standards of Practice Committee members dedicate the vast majority of their professional time to performing interventional procedures; as such they represent a valid broad expert constituency of the subject matter under consideration for standards production.SIR DisclaimerThe clinical practice guidelines of the Society of Interventional Radiology attempt to define practice principles that generally should assist in producing high quality medical care. These guidelines are voluntary and are not rules. A physician may deviate from these guidelines, as necessitated by the individual patient and available resources. These practice guidelines should not be deemed inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other methods of care that are reasonably directed towards the same result. Other sources of information may be used in conjunction with these principles to produce a process leading to high quality medical care. The ultimate judgment regarding the conduct of any specific procedure or course of management must be made by the physician, who should consider all circumstances relevant to the individual clinical situation. Adherence to the SIR Quality Improvement Program will not assure a successful outcome in every situation. It is prudent to document the rationale for any deviation from the suggested practice guidelines in the department policies and procedure manual or in the patient's medical record.Technical documents specifying the exact consensus and literature review methodologies as well as the institutional affiliations and professional credentials of the authors of this document are available upon request from SIR, 3975 Fair Ridge Dr., Suite 400 N., Fairfax, VA 22033.MethodologySIR produces its Standards of Practice documents using the following process. Standards documents of relevance and timeliness are conceptualized by the Standards of Practice Committee members. A recognized expert is identified to serve as the principal author for the standard. Additional authors may be assigned dependent upon the magnitude of the project.An in-depth literature search is performed using electronic medical literature databases. Then a critical review of peer-reviewed articles is performed with regards to the study methodology, results, and conclusions. The qualitative weight of these articles is assembled into an evidence table, which is used to write the document such that it contains evidence-based data with respect to content, rates, and thresholds.When the evidence of literature is weak, conflicting, or contradictory, consensus for the parameter is reached by a minimum of 12 Standards of Practice Committee members using a modified Delphi consensus method (Appendix). For purposes of these documents consensus is defined as 80% Delphi participant agreement on a value or parameter.The draft document is critically reviewed by the members of the Standards of Practice Committee, either by telephone conference calling or face-to-face meeting. The finalized draft from the Committee is sent to the SIR membership for further input/criticism during a 30-day comment period. These comments are discussed by the Subcommittee, and appropriate revisions made to create the finished standards document. Prior to its publication the document is endorsed by the SIR Executive Council.Introduction\u201c[Quality is] a never-ending cycle of continuous improvement.\u201d\u2014W. Edwards Deming, father of the Toyota Production System (1Deming W.E. Out of the crisis.1st ed. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA2000Google Scholar)Quality is not a static goal but a progressively improving state, and interventional radiology is a rapidly moving, technology-driven subspecialty in which high-quality patient care should be the norm. The health care we deliver next year must be better than the health care we deliver today. In order to attain such essential goals, interventional radiology must initiate specialty wide continuous quality improvement (CQI) programs. Ensuring high-quality patient care in interventional radiology is a primary goal and responsibility of the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR).Quality in the United States Health Care SystemSeveral published reports have outlined major problems with quality and patient safety in the United States health care system (2Kohn L.T. Corrigan J. Donaldson M.S. To err is human: building a safer health system. National Academy Press, Washington, DC2000Google Scholar, 3Wennberg J. Cooper M. Dartmouth atlas of healthcare 1999. American Hospital Association, Chicago1999Google Scholar, 4Blackmore C.C. Budenholzer B.

GAO, Washington, DC2007Google Scholar). These reports described how fragmented care and lack of reliable information with which to support clinical decisions and evaluate actual performance resulted in direct patient harm (2Kohn L.T. Corrigan J. Donaldson M.S. To err is human: building a safer health system. National Academy Press, Washington, DC2000Google Scholar), massive variation in quality and access (3Wennberg J. Cooper M. Dartmouth atlas of healthcare 1999. American Hospital Association, Chicago1999Google Scholar), and inconsistent care delivery. High-cost procedures are often performed with little or no evidence to demonstrate their long-term benefits (4Blackmore C.C. Budenholzer B. Applying evidence-based imaging to policy: the Washington State experience.J Am Coll Radiol. 2009; 6: 366-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Treatment regimens often vary so much among providers and institutions that useful comparisons are difficult to obtain (5Marelli L. Stigliano R. Triantos C. et al.Transarterial therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma: which technique is more effective? A systematic review of cohort and randomized studies.Cardiovasc Intervent Radiol. 2007; 30: 6-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Waste abounds in the health care system because of duplication of service lines, inefficient health care delivery, and massive variation in care delivered (3Wennberg J. Cooper M. Dartmouth atlas of healthcare 1999. American Hospital Association, Chicago1999Google Scholar, 6United States Government Accountability OfficeMedicare: focus on physician practice patterns can lead to greater program efficiency. GAO, Washington, DC2007Google Scholar).Multiple national and local initiatives have been launched to address these system-wide problems. For example, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has initiated the Pay for Performance and Physician Quality Reporting Initiative programs, and private payers have incorporated utilization, quality, and outcomes data measurement (7Center for Medicare and Medicaid ServicesPhysician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI) 2009.www.cms.hhs.gov/PQRI/Downloads/2009_PQRI_MeasuresList_030409.pdfGoogle Scholar).Some physician specialty groups have also proactively designed extensive quality improvement programs. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons, for instance, has established standardized metrics and provided members comparative data for more than a decade (8Society of Thoracic SurgeonsSTS Database.www.sts.org/section/stsdatabaseGoogle Scholar). As interventional radiologists continue to increase their clinical presence, we too must design and implement practical, effective specialty-wide quality improvement programs. Establishment of standardized metrics will allow compilation of comparative data. Analysis of these comparative data will permit identification of best practices and lead to the creation of clinical care pathways that deliver more efficient, higher-quality care. Incremental change and regular data analysis will drive constant improvement of care delivery. Such a cycle is commonly used in industry, where it has led to many of the technologic advances from which we benefit daily. Furthermore, in the fields of aviation and nuclear power, human-factors engineering has repeatedly demonstrated that standard processes improve quality while decreasing the impact of inevitable human error (9Duncan J.R. Strategies for improving safety and quality in interventional radiology.J Vasc Interv Radiol. 2008; 19: 3-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).Quality Assurance Versus CQIThe definition of quality varies widely and depends on the product being evaluated and its use. In industry, the factors contributing to overall quality have been referred to as the \u201cdimensions of quality\u201d and include performance, reliability, durability, serviceability, aesthetics, features, perceived quality, and conformance to standards (10Garvin D. Competing on the eight dimensions of quality.Harvard Business Review. 1987; 65: 101-109Google Scholar). In health care, quality has been described as having three parts: the content (ie, the care delivered and its resultant medical outcome), the delivery (ie, \u201cservice\u201d and patient satisfaction with the health care experience), and the cost (11Donabedian A. An introduction to quality assurance in health care. Oxford University Press, New York2003Google Scholar). Because of the subjective nature of health care delivery, patients' value systems and expectations can significantly alter their perception of the quality of the care they receive. A technically successful procedure does not result in high-quality care if it is performed by individuals who are rude to the patient.Two major approaches have been used to try to ensure high quality in health care in the United States: quality assurance (QA) and CQI. The traditional approach to ensuring high-quality health care, QA, uses thresholds to identify low-quality events. Energy is focused on identifying poor individual outcomes or poorly performing practitioners; no significant effort is focused on continuous improvement of technique, process, or patient care. In order to ensure a quality baseline, hospital credentials committees regularly review events considered below the standard of care (ie, complications) and frequently require that practitioners have successfully performed a minimum number of cases before they are granted specific privileges. These methods, however, only identify negative outliers on a bell curve and thereby create a \u201cstatistical tail\u201d (Fig 1a). The concept of a minimal standard of performance is reinforced, and a sense of \u201cgood enough\u201d prevails (12Goldstone J. The role of quality assurance versus continuous quality improvement.J Vasc Surg. 1998; 28: 378-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This atmosphere allows below-average practitioners to continue practicing without making improvements as long as their complication rate remains below a locally accepted threshold. This \u201cgood enough\u201d mentality is a disservice to patients in an era of ever-advancing health care.Whereas QA reacts to individual problem events or problem providers, CQI attempts to anticipate problems and improve processes (13Applegate K.E. Continuous quality improvement for radiologists.Acad Radiol. 2004; 11: 155-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). CQI was initially described by American physicist and engineer Walter Shewhart (14Shewhart W.A. Economic control of quality of manufactured product. American Society for Quality Control, Milwaukee, WI1980Google Scholar). While working at Bell Laboratories, Shewhart realized that reducing process variation, a methodology currently known as industrial quality control, significantly improved the quality of the final product (14Shewhart W.A. Economic control of quality of manufactured product. American Society for Quality Control, Milwaukee, WI1980Google Scholar). Shewhart's writings influenced W. Edwards Deming of Toyota fame. The research of Shewhart and Deming ultimately launched the process improvement concepts of Six Sigma (15McCarty T. The Six Sigma black belt handbook. McGraw-Hill, New York2005Google Scholar) and lean manufacturing (16Womack J.P. Jones D.T. Roos D. The machine that changed the world: how Japan's secret weapon in the global auto wars will revolutionize western industry.1st ed. HarperPerennial, New York1991Google Scholar). Six Sigma attempts to decrease long-term defect levels by decreasing variation and employing standard processes. State-of-the-art manufacturing processes now achieve stunningly low failure rates, below 3.4 defects per million opportunities (a commonly used measure of industrial process performance) (15McCarty T. The Six Sigma black belt handbook. McGraw-Hill, New York2005Google Scholar). Lean manufacturing, also known as \u201clean production,\u201d is a practice that seeks to eliminate steps in a process which add no value (ie, waste)\u2014ie, to achieve more value with less work. This process management philosophy was derived primarily from the Toyota Production System (16Womack J.P. Jones D.T. Roos D. The machine that changed the world: how Japan's secret weapon in the global auto wars will revolutionize western industry.1st ed. HarperPerennial, New York1991Google Scholar).In health care delivery, we are faced with process challenges similar to those in industrial production: the care we provide is the culmination of many distinct, individual processes\u2014eg, scheduling, transportation, performance of the procedure, recovery, education, discharge, and billing. Therefore, improving individual care delivery processes through CQI can lead to greater cumulative improvement than only addressing individual events through QA (Fig 1b).For a CQI program to be successful, it must (i) decrease waste and (ii) limit variation. In medicine, two types of waste exist, quality waste and production waste. Quality waste occurs when resources are used and the effort fails to produce the desired outcome (eg, performance of an inappropriate imaging examination provides no additional clinical benefit). Productivity waste occurs when more resources than necessary are expended to achieve a given clinical outcome (eg, as a result of unique practice styles). When total health care resources are limited, waste and variation do harm. For instance, in the care of a patient with an acutely cold leg and loss of arterial pulses, when emergent angiography would be appropriate, performing a lower-extremity radiography series would be an example of quality waste; and performing lysis using a combination of mechanical and chemical approaches when either approach alone would produce equivalent clinical outcomes would be an example of productivity waste.In health care, one common method to decrease variation, waste, and cost while increasing personal efficiency and clinical effectiveness is the use of treatment pathways or clinical care algorithms. These tools are dynamic, created and regularly updated on the basis of the best evidence available. Regular review of the pathways in light of recent research and institutional outcomes encourages beneficial pathway modifications and continuous improvement. Clinical care algorithms provide the cornerstone of a practical CQI program and facilitate comparative research because a standardized practice enhances the generation of useful, consistent data that are easily collected and analyzed. Small changes in practice standards can be implemented and their effects easily studied. If the effects are positive, the practice standard is modified; if not, the modification is discarded. Such strategies have been well documented to improve overall health care quality (17Jacobs B. Duncan J.R. Improving quality and patient safety by minimizing unnecessary variation.J Vasc Interv Radiol. 2009; 20: 157-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).Systematic Approach to Quality Improvement in Interventional RadiologyQA and CQI programs should reflect the underlying dynamics of a radiology department. Different hospitals cater to different patient populations with different needs. While all interventional radiology quality programs will share certain critical concerns, including patient safety, process improvement, and technical and professional expertise, specific programs will vary among institutions. However, a successful interventional radiology quality program will usually have three parts: a CQI program that measures a broad spectrum of performance indicators within a department, a QA program focusing on individual events and providers, and ongoing small-scale quality improvement projects. Suggested steps in establishing a quality improvement program in an interventional radiology department are outlined here.Form a Radiology Quality CommitteeThe first step in establishing a successful interventional radiology quality improvement program is to form a quality committee. The committee must include both those who deliver the care and those with the authority to make change, and the membership must be broad enough to reflect all segments involved in the patient health care experience. Important points to consider include the following:1A radiology quality committee should include a chief quality officer and nurses, technologists, schedulers, physicians, midlevel providers, administrators, and potentially patients.2The individual responsibilities of all committee members should be clearly defined, mutually accepted, and documented in writing.3Department procedures and policies must be overseen by the quality committee.4A \u201cquality expert\u201d must be identified whose primary job is to ensure that the quality improvement process functions as designed. This quality expert ensures that data are collected, collated, and analyzed at regularly occurring quality committee meetings.5Regular quality committee meetings should be scheduled, and the minutes should be reviewed by physicians and administrators within the department.Identify QA StandardsProfessional QA has been practiced within interventional radiology for years. Examples of QA programs are hospital-based peer review, continuing medical education, and reaccreditation. SIR has published extensive QA documents among its clinical practice guidelines; these documents outline recommended standards of care for individual procedures. Evidence-based standards such as these in combination with internal benchmarks can provide the structure necessary to establish a robust QA program.Understand the System and Define its ProcessesHealth care delivery is a complex system containing multiple distinct processes. In order to measure, analyze, and ultimately improve care, a QA committee must dissect the system into its separate processes, which are then individually addressed. Flowcharts, cause-and-effect diagrams, and Pareto charts can be very helpful by showing critical steps, problems, and potential bottlenecks, all areas of significant potential improvement. A flow chart is a common type of chart in which each step in a process resides within a shape, connected in order by arrows. Flowcharts are used to reduce and visually analyze a process into discrete steps that can individually be measured and managed. Cause-and-effect diagrams (also called fishbone diagrams or Ishikawa diagrams) are tools used to show the potential causes of an event. A Pareto chart is a special type of bar chart in which the values being plotted are arranged in descending order. The graph is accompanied by a line graph that shows the cumulative totals of each category, left to right. One example of a complex system is emergent computed tomographic (CT) imaging and intervention in stroke patients. As timeliness directly affects outcomes, accurate information must be obtained and proper triage performed very quickly. Small delays in multiple processes can accumulate and result in significant patient harm. Critical steps can be chosen, and potential bottlenecks labeled on a flow diagram, to demonstrate patient movement through the system and delineate the various processes involved (Fig 2).Figure 2Flowchart of movement of an emergency room patient with a possible stroke through initial clinical and imaging evaluation. Four subprocesses are identified, and four corresponding metrics are created. Because avoidance of delays is critical to good outcome of patients with stroke, the metrics were defined as time required to complete each process. (Available in color online at www.jvir.org.)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Establish Metrics and Set Threshold ValuesAfter identifying critical departmental processes and the various steps in these processes, the quality committee must establish metrics that will provide the most useful data. The importance of metric selection must be underscored. Good metrics provide reliable, timely, and reproducible data that accurately represent the process in question. Flowcharts are often helpful in determining the critical areas on which metrics should focus. In our emergent stroke imaging example (Fig 2), four critical subprocesses were identified and the corresponding metrics created. National guidelines such as those issued by the Joint Commission, National Quality Forum best practices, and Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Physician Quality Reporting Initiative can also serve as good sources of metrics (18The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare OrganizationsNational Patient Safety Goals Accreditation Program: Hospitals.www.jointcommission.org/NR/rdonlyres/31666E86-E7F4-423E-9BE8-F05BD1CB0AA8/0/HAP_NPSG.pdfGoogle Scholar). Although current systems provide little financial incentive for providers to report data (Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services has a 2% of estimated total allowable charges incentive payment [19Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services2009 PQRI\u2013Incentives Payments.http://www.cms.hhs.gov/PQRI/25_AnalysisAndPayment.aspGoogle Scholar]), required external reporting is only expected to become more common in the future.The quality committee should consider establishing threshold values for certain metrics, such that if the value of a metric is beyond the acceptable threshold, not only is the value recorded but a cascade of further investigation is triggered. The threshold values can be based on external benchmarks (eg, those of SIR) or internal benchmarks and will vary depending on the process in question. For example, although a threshold reporting rate of 100% for adverse events and critical results is reasonable; a similar threshold for successful image-guided percutaneous biopsy would not be.Collect and Analyze DataData-based decision making is a core concept within CQI. Unfortunately, though, data collection often is challenging: for example, the institutional electronic medical record may have limitations, as may the radiology information system. Assistance from the institution's information technology professionals may be required to efficiently access and compile an institution's collected data. Furthermore, although manual data collection is less efficient and more costly than electronic data collection, and has increased potential for human error, it is sufficient to start a CQI program. Simply graphing data over time and creating an annotated run chart can be remarkably valuable. Returning to our example of emergent CT imaging for stroke, a run chart could be created to evaluate transport time. Baseline data could be collected for metric 2\u2014the time from when the transporter was called to when the patient arrived at the CT scanner\u2014and presented graphically using a basic annotated run chart (Fig 3).Figure 3Run chart showing data from a continuous quality improvement study of the transport time for patients from the emergency room to the CT imaging unit (metric 2 in Fig 2). (Available in color online at www.jvir.org.)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Initiate a Quality Improvement ProjectA good strategy for quality improvement in health care is rapid cycle improvement. Rapid cycle improvement is simple, requires no special training, is easily implemented, and uses the scientific method. Initially described by Shewhart (14Shewhart W.A. Economic control of quality of manufactured product. American Society for Quality Control, Milwaukee, WI1980Google Scholar) and later modified by Langley (20Langley G.J. The improvement guide: a practical approach to enhancing organizational performance.2nd edition. Jossey-Bass, San Francisco2009Google Scholar), rapid cycle improvement consists of ongoing \u201cplan, do, study, act\u201d (PDSA) cycles. The rapid cycle PDSA concept provides a framework for incremental data-driven system change. Returning to our example of emergency imaging for stroke patients, here is how a PDSA cycle might play out:1Plan: The quality committee plans specific process modifications to reduce the total time for emergent CT imaging in stroke patients. Brainstorming sessions and evaluation of flow diagrams show that transport is a potential bottleneck. Data on transport time (from when the transporter is notified to when the patient arrives at the CT scanner) are recorded over a finite period, and a run chart is created as shown in Figure 3; the data demonstrate that transport times are unacceptable. The quality committee plans to add a second transporter to see if this improves transport times.2Do: A pilot study is initiated of the effect of adding a second transporter to the schedule. Transport-time data are collected during the pilot study.3Study: Comparison of the data collected during the pilot study and the baseline data (before addition of the second transporter) shows that the addition of a second transporter significantly decreased the transport time and allowed patients to be triaged faster, as demonstrated by a downward shift in the run chart (Fig 4). A run chart is often adequate; however, a more complex display of data and analysis could be performed by a hospital's quality or industrial engineers if necessary. Advanced data analysis using various types of control charts is beyond the scope of this discussion. Should further information be desired, an excellent book on the application of control charts in clinical practice is available (21Carey R.G. Improving healthcare with control charts: basic and advanced SPC methods and case studies. ASQ Quality Press, Milwaukee, WI2003Google Scholar).Figure 4Run chart showing data from a CQI study of the transport time for patients from the emergency room to the CT imaging unit (metric 2 in Fig 2). Addition of a second transporter on day 14 resulted in decreased transport time. (Available in color online at www.jvir.org.)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)4Act: Respond to the measurement\u2014either implement the successfully tested change or try another change. As the pilot study demonstrated significant improvement when a second transporter was added, staffing should be permanently increased. Such process changes requiring additional cost (eg, for additional hospital personnel) encounter much less resistance when objective data justify their implementation. If, conversely, the pilot study had shown no improvement in transport times, the focus would have been shifted. A new PDSA cycle would have been started centered on a different part of the process (perhaps time required for interpretation by the physician).One can easily appreciate how the PDSA method provides a simple way to continuously improve quality.PDSA-based quality improvement strategies are not restricted to clinical operations\u2014they can also be used to improve the performance of individual health professionals. A large interventional radiology practice will often have much variation in how individual physicians perform procedures. In such cases, data analysis leading to incremental changes can result in improvement in processes such as interpreting images or performing procedures. For example, a PDSA study could be constructed to evaluate the entire process of uterine artery embolization for symptomatic leiomyomas. A complete analysis would extend from initial patient contact through to clinical outcome. Such a study would be somewhat more complex, encompassing operational and clinical metrics. Initially, a flowchart would be created and metrics chosen that best reflect subprocesses of greatest interest and importance. Examples would include:Process Metrics1Preprocedure schedulingaTime from initial contact or consult submission (office scheduling delays)bTime from clinical appointment to procedure (procedure

They are often a consequence of persistence of elements from the fetal circulation, in particular the ductus venosus. Patients with congenital portosystemic shunts often have no signs or symptoms of disease until adulthood, at which time encephalopathy is the leading presenting symptom (3\u20136). Shunts may be discovered during surgery for other reasons and as incidental findings during sonography or computed tomography. Recent advances in interventional radiology have provided an opportunity to change management strategies from surgical to less invasive interventions (7\u20139). We report two children with symptomatic portosystemic shunts in whom interventional radiology was used to obliterate the shunts. Clinical symptoms and neurocognitive function improved in both children after the shunts were obliterated and hepatic portal venous perfusion restored. CASE REPORTS Case 1 A 16-year-old girl presented with nonpitting edema and telangiectasias of the lower extremities. Her medical history included a small ventricular septal defect that had spontaneously closed, Caffey disease, and mild nonconjugated hyperbilirubinemia consistent with Gilbert disease. She used no oral contraceptives. A cardiac murmur on physical examination led to an echocardiogram that showed no structural cardiac disease. A liver mass was found incidentally. The liver was reported to be normal on physical examination. Her serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was 50 IU/L (normal, <40 IU/L); aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 70 IU/L (normal, <45 IU/L); gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), 126 IU/L (normal, <40 IU/L); total protein 6.5 g/dL; albumin 3.3 g/dL; and total and conjugated bilirubin 2.5 and 0.1 mg/dL (normal, <1.2 and <0.4 mg/dL), respectively. Serum cholylglycine by radioimmunoassay was 827 pg/dL (normal, <64 pg/dL). Abdominal sonography and computed tomography revealed an isolated mass in the right lobe of liver. At surgical exploration, a 10- \u00d7 7- \u00d7 3.8-cm nodule was completely resected from the inferior right lobe. Three other nodules, two in the right upper lobe and one in the quadrate lobe, were identified but not resected. The histologic findings of the resected nodule were typical of focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) (Fig. 1). She developed low-grade encephalopathy during the next 4 months, with deteriorating school performance and episodes of combative behavior. Her blood ammonia was 110 pmol/L (normal, 11\u201335 pmol/L). Her symptoms and blood ammonia improved when lactulose syrup was prescribed.FIG. 1.: Fibrous satellite scar within the hyperplastic nodule. Thick-walled arteries (A), portal venules (V), and bile ductule (Bd) proliferation can be detected.The patient was referred to our service 1 year after surgical exploration. Her school performance had again deteriorated. The former \u201cB\u201d student was failing. She was apathetic and had a flat affect. Her liver was palpable 10 cm below the xiphoid and was not palpable below the right costal margin in the anterior axillary line. There was no splenomegaly or ascites. Her lower legs showed extensive cutaneous telangiectasias and nonpitting edema. Numerous spider angiomas were present on her arms and back. Her only laboratory abnormalities were a mild leukopenia (3.7 K/pL) and hypoalbuminemia (3.3 g/dL). Low-grade encephalopathy, hyperammonemia, and elevated serum cholylglycine levels suggested portosystemic shunting. Sonography with Doppler failed to demonstrate a site of shunting. A review of computed tomography images suggested the presence of a patent ductus venosus (PDV). PDV was confirmed by superior mesenteric artery angiogram. The study also demonstrated multiple hypervascular nodules within the liver, especially in the enlarged left lobe. Using a transjugular approach, the portal vein was catheterized via the PDV. A venogram demonstrated another large shunt between the right portal and hepatic veins and numerous small intra-hepatic venovenous shunts (Fig. 2A). There was complete absence of parenchymal perfusion by portal blood.FIG. 2.: (A) Case 1. Two main shunts can be seen, PDV and shunt between right portal vein and right hepatic vein. PDV, Patent ductus venosus; s, shunt; PV, portal vein; HV: hepatic vein; RA, right atrium. (B) Case 1. No flow can be seen through shunts after multiple staged coil embolizations. PV, portal vein.Occlusion of the two main shunts briefly with a balloon resulted in increased perfusion of the hepatic parenchyma but a 20 mmHg rise in portal vein pressure. We assumed that the portal system would not tolerate simultaneous occlusion of these shunts, and a staged embolization was planned. Initially, a spider obstructing device was placed in the PDV, and multiple coils were packed upstream to completely obliterate it. One month later, a near complete occlusion of the right portal vein to the hepatic vein shunt was achieved using the same technique. After this procedure, there was hepatopetal flow in the portal vein and good perfusion of the hepatic parenchyma (Fig. 2B). The patient\u2019s mood and school performance improved. Four months later, she returned with recurrence of apathy and poor school performance. Neurocognitive testing was performed, which showed findings consistent with organic brain dysfunction (results described below). The blood ammonia level was normal. A functional magnetic resonance scan of her brain showed only subtle nonspecific changes. A retrograde hepatic venogram showed excellent portal perfusion of the liver, but catheterization of the remaining shunts was not possible. Seven months later, a residual large shunt between the portal vein and right hepatic vein was successfully embolized. In the following year, she experienced a few brief episodes of lethargy that improved with lactulose administration. Her liver function remained normal. Mild hypersplenism persisted with a leukocyte count of 4.2 K/\u03bcL and platelets of 87 K/\u03bcL. Repeat neurocognitive testing showed considerable improvement in several areas of function. One other prominent venous shunt was obliterated angiographically, and final vascular study performed 1 year later demonstrated normal hepatic portal vein perfusion. A few small intrahepatic venovenous shunts were still present but had not increased in size and were too small to catheterize for embolization. In the 2 years since obliteration of the shunts, she has had improved mood, strength, and stamina. Her school performance returned to its pretreatment level. She attended junior college with average academic performance and was recently married. She is currently employed full time. Her leg edema and telangiectasias have mostly resolved. Her unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia has not resolved, suggesting that it was more likely a result of Gilbert disease than of portosystemic shunting. Case 2 A 3-month-old infant with multiple cutaneous hemangiomas underwent sonography to investigate an eventration of the right hemidiaphragm discovered on chest x-ray. A hemangioma was identified within the dome of the right lobe of the liver, which appeared to be partially obstructing the hepatic venous outflow. Blood vessels with large flow detected by Doppler ultrasound were thought to be associated with the hemangioma. The liver was soft and of normal size, and there was no splenomegaly. Liver function test results were normal. One year after presentation, an ultrasound done to evaluate hepatic outflow showed a regression of the hemangioma but a worsening of the appearance of the high flow vessels. In the venous phase of the superior mesenteric arteriogram, a hemangioma comprising 25% to 30% of the right lobe of liver and a large PDV rapidly shunting most portal flow into the right atrium were found (Fig. 3A). A large atrial septal defect also was demonstrated. The hepatic hemangioma disappeared spontaneously by 2.5 years of age, and the septal defect was surgically closed shortly thereafter.FIG. 3.: (A) Case 2. PDV and filling of hemangioma with contrast material at the bottom of figure. PDV, patent ductus venosus; PV, portal vein. (B) Case 2. No flow through PDV after two stents and coil placements. PV, portal vein.The child\u2019s parents became concerned about delayed development at 3 years of age. Their concerns were confirmed by Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale 4th edition (10) during evaluations at preschool. We performed a comprehensive neurocognitive evaluation at 4 years, which indicated he had deficits indicative of organic brain dysfunction (results reported below). His liver size remained normal, but the spleen became palpable 2 cm below the left costal margin. An endoscopy demonstrated no varices. Because the child\u2019s neurodevelopmental assessment suggested there was low-grade hepatic encephalopathy, embolization of the PDV was planned. The transjugular route was used to enter the PDV. Test balloon occlusion of the PDV produced a pressure gradient of 20 mmHg between the portal vein and the right atrium, indicating that staged closure was necessary. A treatment strategy was used that depended on the natural tendency for wire mesh stents placed intraluminally to endothelialize and develop intimal hyperplasia. Two stents were deployed in the PDV, one inside the other at an interval of 2 months. Ultrasound was used to determine flow in the PDV and the need for additional intervention. After 1 month, shunt flow was reduced to a level allowing transvenously placed coils to complete the obliteration of the PDV (Fig. 3B). Portal perfusion of the hepatic parenchyma appeared normal. The patient\u2019s parents reported some improvement in his school performance after PDV closure. Neurocognitive testing after shunt closure showed improvement in several areas of function. However, he continued to display disruptive behavior, repetitive motor movements, and mild social skills deficits, and received a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome. Two years after shunt closure, he has shown additional gradual improvement in all aspects of his behavior and performance. His strength and stamina have improved significantly, although he has persistent weakness on his left side. He currently attends special classes for children with attention deficit disorders, in which he functions acceptably. Neurocognitive Function Before and After Closure of Portosystemic Shunts In both cases, neuropsychologic evaluation was performed around the time of treatment and then well after closure of the shunts. Tests used were predominantly standardized measures with norms derived from extensive samples based on age and other factors. Specific information regarding each test can be found in individual test manuals (see Tables 1 and 2 for references). Although an attempt was made when possible to use the same measures before and after treatment, this was less feasible in patient 2. Tables 1 and 2 present the data as standard scores, which have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15, and represent the tested child\u2019s function relative to expectations for age. Comparisons of results between the two evaluations were made based on the change in scores and the standard error of measurement (SEM) of the test, which is an estimation of the amount of error attributable to unreliability in an individual\u2019s observed test score (11). Using this method, 95% confidence intervals were constructed for each test when SEMs were available. A difference in score (Z score) before and after treatment exceeding the 95% confidence interval was considered significant. However, this statistic may be questioned because our patients are single cases, and the comparisons made are between single repeated tests and not those of large groups. Given the limitations of current quantitative data, our interpretations are also based on available qualitative data.TABLE 1: Neurocognitive functioning for case 1TABLE 2: Neurocognitive functioning for case 2Patient 1 had neuropsychologic evaluation at age 17 years and again at 18 7/12 years. At the time of her initial evaluation, she reported difficulty with attention, memory, and fatigue. Testing showed intellectual ability in the low average range. She had specific difficulties in the areas of working memory (mental juggling of complex material, mental multitasking), attention, learning and memory (likely related to attention), fine motor speed, and energy/stamina. She had a flat affect, which she later acknowledged was associated with other symptoms of depressed mood. Re-evaluation 19 months later indicated stable or improved function. Performance improved most in the areas of fine motor speed, mood, energy and stamina, learning, and memory (likely related to attentional factors). Stable, mild to moderate deficits remained in the areas of working memory and sustained attention. Her mood had normalized. See Table 1 for details. Patient 2 underwent neuropsychologic evaluation at age 41/12 years and at age 511/12 years. At the initial evaluation, his parents were concerned about attention and anxiety. Testing revealed global mild cognitive delays and delayed adaptive (self-help) skills. Re-evaluation after shunt closure revealed striking improvement in intellectual ability. However, concerns about attention and anxiety remained. Furthermore, he displayed mild to moderate difficulty with learning and memory (likely related to attention) and persistent deficits in adaptive skills. Fine motor speed and dexterity also remained below average for age. See Table 2 for details. In both cases, there was evidence of improved neurocognitive functioning after closure of the portosystemic shunts and restoration of hepatic portal venous perfusion. In patient 1, an adolescent at the time of intervention, improvement was seen in mood, energy, and fine motor speed. Stability in attention allowed for more effective learning of new information. It is possible that her improved mood also contributed to her higher functioning. However, stable deficits remained in other areas of \u201cfluid\u201d functioning, including sustained attention and working memory, which often are sensitive to mood changes. It is also possible that her depressed mood at the time of initial testing was a symptom of low-grade hepatic encephalopathy, which improved along with neurocognitive function after closure of her shunts. In patient 2, a preschooler at the time of his surgery, more global developmental and intellectual delays were observed initially, which improved after obliteration of his portosystemic shunt. This patient\u2019s pattern of global delays with early disease onset in contrast to more circumscribed deficits primarily in fluid functioning with later disease onset is observed with many types of brain insult occurring during neural development (12). The relationship of his Asperger syndrome to the portosystemic shunting is unclear, especially in light of his neurocognitive improvement at the time that diagnosis was made. DISCUSSION These cases illustrate some important aspects of an emerging understanding of congenital portosystemic shunts. First, we used a treatment paradigm employing interventional radiology, rather than surgery. Second, our evaluations of these two patients suggest that shunting of portal blood from the liver may have major consequences on neurologic development and learning. Finally, we observed a novel association between congenital portosystemic shunts and FNH. Experience with these patients suggests that congenital portosystemic shunts should not be considered to be benign. Rather, they may have deleterious effects on neurologic development and function. The literature suggests that patients with congenital portosystemic venous shunts often have no symptoms until adulthood, when alterations in neurocognitive function develop (3,5,6,13\u201315). However, the question remains whether early detection and intervention might improve performance in adult patients long before clinical symptoms develop. Recent reports suggest that children with congenital portosystemic shunts are likely to have neurologic symptoms and that their intensity correlates with the magnitude of shunting (4,16). It is not clear why or how portosystemic shunting affects neurologic function. There is substantial evidence that poor neurocognitive outcome is associated with earlier age of onset in a number of medical conditions, such as closed head injury, cranial irradiation, hydrocephalus, heart disease, and liver disease (12,17\u201319). Subclinical hepatic encephalopathy has been reported in an infant with congenital absence of the portal vein (20), and we have observed defects in neurocognitive function in children with idiopathic extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis (21) that resolve after restoration of portal flow by mesenteric to left portal vein bypass surgery (22) (unreported data). These observations and the findings in the current cases suggest that the developing nervous system might be sensitive to the effect of portosystemic shunting and/or deprivation of portal blood flow to the liver. Damage incurred during development could reduce the functional capacity of the adult. These speculations suggest that early closure of shunts and restoration of portal flow to the liver is indicated if it can be done without harm to the patient. Both of our patients had impairment of neurocognitive function to a degree that treatment was clearly indicated. Initially, neither had any demonstrable flow in the intrahepatic portal venous system, and all mesenteric flow passed immediately through the shunts. Coincident with obliteration of shunts, both had dramatic increases in portal blood flow to the hepatic parenchyma. The fact that portal pressure increased to unacceptably high levels on test occlusion of the shunts indicated that the portal system might not tolerate an increased flow after shunt obliteration. Dye studies during test occlusion showed small, underdeveloped portal venous systems in both patients. Staged occlusion resulted in increased size and resumption of normal flow in the portal system. We cannot say with certainty whether elimination of shunting or restoration of hepatic parenchymal perfusion was the cause of the improved neurologic function we observed. In cirrhosis, poor hepatic perfusion with portal blood seems to have a greater propensity to cause encephalopathy than does the presence of major portosystemic shunts (23). We think that restoration of portal flow was a major benefit to the treatment approach we used in these patients. Liver tumors consistent with FNH were detected during the evaluation of lower limb edema in our first patient. At the time of her initial evaluation, she had no signs or symptoms suggesting either liver disease or a congenital portosystemic shunt. Indeed, the shunt was not detected during comprehensive imaging and surgical removal of the largest of the tumors. FNH has been reported in patients with absent or atretic portal veins, portal hypertension, intrahepatic portosystemic venous shunts, patent ductus venosus, hepatic hemangiomas, and surgical splenorenal shunts (14,24\u201338). All of these conditions produce or are associated with reduced portal blood supply, which may play a role in the development of FNH. We suggest that the discovery of FNH in a child should raise suspicion that a portosystemic vascular imbalance might be present. The pathogenesis of FNH is unknown. It appears to be a reactive process, rather than an autonomous proliferation of hepatocytes (such as hepatic adenoma or adeno-carcinoma). Pre-existing arterial malformations and irregular distribution of hepatic blood supply have been hypothesized to produce hyperplastic responses in the liver parenchyma, leading to nodule formation (39,40). Why an imbalance in blood supply may cause the liver to develop nodules remains to be determined. Uneven distribution of nutrients and factors regulating hepatocyte regeneration may play a role (41). The reported association between FNH and telangiectasis of the limbs, as observed in our patient, and with central nervous system and endocrine tumors, vascular malformations of other organs, and hemihypertrophy all suggest there may also be systemic maldistribution of growth factors in this disease (28,31,37,38). Our experience has led us to consider a pre-emptive approach to treating children with congenital portosystemic shunts. We suspect that these shunts are not, in fact, benign in childhood. We suggest that neurocognitive function in young children with shunts should be evaluated before deficits are clinically evident. Definitive treatment can then be undertaken as soon as abnormalities are detected. The effectiveness of conservative management of low-grade hepatic encephalopathy by protein-restricted diet and lactulose administration has not been established in children with congenital portosystemic shunts. Given the rarity of the condition, response to these measures may never be adequately tested. We think that conservative therapy may be used as an adjunct or a prelude to definitive treatment but should not constitute the main therapeutic strategy. It appears that neurocognitive dysfunction is likely when there is a markedly diminished portal blood flow to the hepatic parenchyma. Therefore, we suggest that obliterative treatment should be considered as preventative therapy in patients with congenital portosystemic shunts and severely reduced portal blood flow, even before neurocognitive dysfunction is detected. Children with unexplained neurocognitive dysfunction consistent with mild hepatic encephalopathy (e.g., disturbed memory, reduced attention span) should be evaluated for the possibility of portosystemic shunting (6,20,42,43). The yield for such an evaluation would be low because congenital portosystemic shunts are rare, but the absence of signs and symptoms pointing to liver disease in these children makes routine clinical evaluation unreliable. Finding a shunt presents a potentially treatable cause for brain dysfunction. Although hyperammonemia is not a consistent finding, measuring blood ammonia after protein loading might detect patients with this condition. Surgery has been the mainstay of treatment for this disease in the past. Recent innovations in interventional radiology now provide an alternative to surgical intervention. We think that angiography is necessary before any invasive intervention because the size and number of shunts and the existence of other vascular anomalies determine the appropriate approach. The presence of numerous shunts, as observed in our first patient, requires planned repetitive embolization procedures. Portal hypertension may result from abrupt changes in portal hemodynamics, which may also determine the need for a staged procedure. During test balloon occlusions in our patients, hypoplastic intrahepatic portal systems did not appear to tolerate the newly established portal blood load. Therefore, staged occlusive procedures were performed to permit the portal system to adjust to its new hemodynamic status. Dislodgment of coils into the systemic circulation is a risk during these procedures. The association of congenital portosystemic shunts with cardiac anomalies heightens the risk for stroke. Both of our patients had cardiac septal defects, one of which required surgical closure. All patients should have a careful cardiac evaluation before treatment is undertaken. Embolization of shunts has been successfully performed via transhepatic, mesenteric, umbilical venous, and transcaval routes (7\u20139,16,44,45). We completed obliteration of the shunts in our patients via the transjugular route. Modern pediatric interventional radiology permits this treatment even in very small patients, as illustrated by its use in a newborn with hepatic failure and a patent ductus venosus, which was obliterated during preparation for hepatocyte transplantation (46). In summary, these two cases emphasize the presenting symptoms and a novel treatment to congenital portosystemic shunts. Although sonography and computed tomography have increased the detection rate of these lesions, angiography is valuable for visualization of complicated lesions. Interventional radiology was successfully used to obliterate the shunts in our patients and resulted in improved neurocognitive function. We hypothesize that deprivation of portal blood to the liver was a key determinant in the development of neurocognitive abnormalities."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2921717639", "relevance_score":

Conventional biopsy protocols are based on standard 12-core transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy.To assess the value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/TRUS fusion biopsy over 4-yr follow-up in men on AS for low-risk PC.Between 2010 and 2018, a total of 273 men were included. Of them, 157 men with initial 12-core TRUS biopsy and 116 with initial MRI/TRUS fusion biopsy were followed by systematic and targeted transperineal MRI/TRUS fusion biopsies based on Prostate Cancer Research International Active Surveillance criteria. MRI from follow-up MRI/TRUS fusion biopsy was assessed using the Prostate Cancer Radiological Estimation of Change in Sequential Evaluation (PRECISE) scoring system.AS-disqualification rates for patients on AS initially diagnosed by either 12-core TRUS biopsy or by MRI/TRUS fusion biopsy were compared using Kaplan-Meier estimates, log-rank tests, and regression analyses. We also analyzed the influence of negative primary MRI and PRECISE scoring to predict AS disqualification using Kaplan-Meier estimates, log-rank tests, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.Of men diagnosed by 12-core TRUS biopsy, 59% were disqualified from AS based on the results of subsequent MRI/TRUS fusion biopsy. In the initial MRI fusion biopsy cohort, upgrading occurred significantly less frequently (19%, p<0.001). ROC curve analyses demonstrated good discrimination for the PRECISE score with an area under the curve of 0.83. No men with a PRECISE score of 1 or 2 (demonstrating absence or downgrading of lesions in follow-up MRI) were disqualified from AS. In our cohort, a negative baseline MRI scan was not a predictor of nondisqualification from AS. Limitations include transperineal approach and extended systematic biopsies used with MRI/TRUS fusion biopsy, which may not be representative of other centers.MRI/TRUS fusion biopsies allow a reliable risk classification for patients who are candidates for AS. The application of the PRECISE scoring system demonstrated good discrimination.In this study, we investigated the value of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRI/transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) fusion biopsies for the assessment of active surveillance (AS) reliability using the Prostate Cancer Radiological Estimation of Change in Sequential Evaluation criteria. Standard TRUS biopsies lead to significant underestimation of prostate cancer. In contrast, MRI/TRUS fusion biopsies allowed for a more reliable risk classification. For appropriate inclusion into AS, men should receive either an initial or a confirmatory MRI/TRUS fusion biopsy."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2159208758", "relevance_score": 124.57687,

This white paper from the 2011 RAD-AID conference represents consensus advocacy of multidisciplinary strategies to improve the planning, accessibility, and quality of imaging services in the developing world.

IntroductionRadiologic services are scarce or nonexistent for most of the world's population. Recent reports from the World Health Organization (WHO) estimate that one-half to two-thirds of the world's population lacks access to medical imaging. On the basis of a recent global population census of approximately 7 billion people, this suggests a radiologic scarcity afflicting 3.5 billion to 4.7 billion individuals throughout the world. This disparity has widened over time because of a relative lack of progress in less developed regions (Figure 1) [1United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic RadiationSources and effects of ionizing radiation.UNSCEAR. 2008; (Report 2008, Volume I. Vienna, Austria: United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation)Google Scholar].With the widespread role of imaging in patient care for pulmonary disease, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, maternal-infant health, tuberculosis (TB), cancer screening and management, and trauma, this disparity of radiologic access translates into a significant contributor to overall health care disparity [2Levine A.C. Presser D.Z. Rosborough S. Ghebreyesus T.A.

Research on cancer prevention, detection and management in low- and medium-income countries.Ann Oncol. 2010; 21: 1935-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar]. In addition to disparate accessibility of radiologic services, WHO also identifies large gaps in image service quality and deficiencies in radiologic service planning that exacerbate the radiology divide.In this white paper, we describe and analyze multiple strategies for addressing the global radiology divide on the basis of presentations at the 2011 RAD-AID Conference on International Radiology for Developing Countries. Building on the growing consensus and data summarized in prior RAD-AID conference white papers [6Welling R.D. Azene E.M. Kalia V. et al.White paper report of the 2010 RAD-AID Conference on International Radiology for Developing Countries: identifying sustainable strategies for imaging services in the developing world.J Am Coll Radiol. 2011; 8: 556-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 7Mollura D.J. Azene E.M. Starikovsky A. et al.White paper report of the RAD-AID Conference on International Radiology for Developing Countries: identifying challenges, opportunities, and strategies for imaging services in the developing world.J Am Coll Radiol. 2010; 7: 495-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar], we advocate for ongoing multidisciplinary strategies to arrive at innovative solutions for medical imaging, including (1) economic development for financial sustainability in enterprise planning, (2) public health mechanisms to address treatment and prevention at the community level, (3) comparative clinical models to implement various clinical and workflow strategies adapted to unique developing world community contexts, (4) education to improve training and optimize service quality, and (5) technology innovation to bring new technical capabilities to limited-resource regions. The RAD-AID conference advances this interdisciplinary agenda to address the complex task of improving radiologic service.Economic Development for Global RadiologyRadiology has a broad range of economic capital needs for implementation, from low-cost portable ultrasound to capital-intensive cross-sectional modalities such as CT, PET, and MRI, with diverse technologies in the middle of the economic spectrum such as radiography and mammography. Cost levels are further complicated by the range of data solutions, such as analog printed film (still prevalent in the developing world) and digital data storage via a PACS. Optimizing radiologic solutions for a given community or facility is paramount to achieve the highest clinical yield. Given the range of economic scale involved in planning radiology for the developing world, WHO has emphasized the need to improve radiology needs assessment and planning before implementing hardware, software, and personnel: \u201cHealth care technologies are seen as peripheral to health care planners \u2026 . The most important prerequisite \u2026 is that the potential recipient truly needs the \u2026 equipment and has the expertise and means to operate and maintain it\u201d [8World Health OrganizationGuidelines for Health Care Equipment Donation, 2000.http://www.who.int/hac/techguidance/pht/1_equipment%20donationbuletin82WHO.pdfGoogle Scholar].To address the need for robust economic planning, partnerships between leading business schools and radiologic service organizations have been initiated as a means to create comprehensive business plans for new radiologic services. One example is the partnership between RAD-AID and the Columbia School of Business via Columbia's Pangea nonprofit assistance program. Volunteer MBA students traveled with RAD-AID's radiologic service team to India in January 2011 to gather information and formulate a business plan that will provide mobile imaging and health care education to marginalized women in slums and rural regions. This program served as a follow-up to RAD-AID's Radiology-Readiness assessment performed in northern India in 2010, which identified women's health as a pressing unmet need [9Greenemeier L. PET Project: radiologists push imaging technologies in developing countries.http://wwwscientificamericancom/articlecfm?id=radiology-developing-countriesGoogle Scholar].The Wharton School of Business Global Consulting Practicum is another example of the integration of health and business professionals, offering a wide range of strategies to a variety of businesses and industries. As a model for nonprofit health care service advancement, the Wharton Global Consulting Practicum assisted Hope Village, a South African nongovernmental organization, to optimize efforts on behalf of orphans affected by acquired immune deficiency syndrome, thus improving the nongovernmental organization's economic development and social impact [10Wharton School of BusinessGCP team helps to advance economic development efforts of Mosaic (previously Hope Village), South Africa-based NGO, 4/26/2010.http://mktgweb.wharton.upenn.edu/gcpcourse/Google Scholar].Partnering radiology nonprofit outreach with academic business programs yields several key benefits to both the business and radiology professional communities: (1) it improves the strategic planning process for long-term economic sustainability, (2) it educates the business community about the vital role of imaging technologies in health care systems, (3) it educates radiology health care personnel on business practices and economic analytic tools, and (4) it generates cross-pollination of economic and health care ideas for innovation. On the basis of initial pilots of RAD-AID's partnerships with business schools, the aim is to deepen, replicate, and expand these collaborations with other academic business institutions for more robust business plan development in the future.Radiology and Public Health for the Developing WorldIn contrast to care at the doctor-patient level, public health addresses the role of radiology at the community level to guide public policy and address epidemiologic challenges [11Hillman B.J. Radiology and public health.J Am Coll Radiol. 2008; 5: 155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar]. This is a key element of radiology in developing countries because radiologic service planning for underserved populations necessitates an in-depth understanding of a population's culture, disease patterns, and health care system. Tuberculosis is one example of radiologic scarcity broadly affecting public health efforts in the developing world, with 9.4 million new cases, 1.3 million deaths, and 9.7 million children orphaned by parental TB deaths annually [12Harries A.D. Banda H.T. Boeree M.J. et al.Management of pulmonary tuberculosis suspects with negative sputum smears and normal or minimally abnormal chest radiographs in resource-poor settings.Int J Tuberc Lung Dis. 1998; 2: 999-1004PubMed Google Scholar]. Tuberculosis disease can be difficult to diagnose definitively. This is often due to the unavailability of bacterial cultures. Even when culture facilities are accessible, results are not available for at least 4 to 6 weeks because of the slow growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which causes TB [3Siddiqi K. Lambert M.L. Walley J. Clinical diagnosis of smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis in low-income countries: the current evidence.Lancet Infect Dis. 2003; 3: 288-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 13World Health OrganizationTuberculosis Fact Sheet.http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factssheets/fs104/en/Google Scholar]. In addition, because young children cannot produce sputa and have a higher incidence of extrapulmonary disease, the sensitivity of cultures and new automated nucleic acid amplification methods is extremely low (<20%) [14Nelson L.J. Wells C.D. Global epidemiology of childhood tuberculosis.Int J Tuberc Lung Dis. 2004; 8: 636-647PubMed Google Scholar, 15Getahun H. Harrington M. O'Brien R. Nunn P.

Therefore, chest radiographs are regarded as a key component of diagnosis and treatment monitoring, particularly among pediatric patients and those infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. Because most TB cases are now in the developing world, the inadequate quality and scarcity of chest imaging significantly limits global public health efforts to control the disease [18Mathers C. Fat D.M. Boerma J.T. World Health OrganizationThe global burden of disease: 2004 update. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland2008Google Scholar]. As advanced imaging is developed and validated to better diagnose and monitor TB, the scalability of imaging will become an important component of disease control [19Davis S.L. Nuermberger E.L. Um P.K. et al.Noninvasive pulmonary [18F]-2-fluoro-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography correlates with bactericidal activity of tuberculosis drug treatment.Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2009; 53: 4879-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 20Sathekge M.

Use of 18F-FDG PET to predict response to first-line tuberculostatics in HIV-associated tuberculosis.J Nucl Med. 2011; 52: 880-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar].Women's health is another significant public health issue affected by the radiology divide. Examples include osteoporosis, diagnosed by bone densitometry, and breast cancer, detectable by mammography and ultrasound [21Cazap E. Distelhorst S.R. Anderson B.O.

Osteoporosis affects 200 million women worldwide and is a particularly widespread challenge in India, affecting 1 in 3 women [23International Osteoporosis FoundationFacts and statistics about osteoporosis and its impact.http://www.iofbonehealth.org/facts-and-statistics.htmlGoogle Scholar]. RAD-AID has engaged public health and medical institutions in northern India to implement a mobile women's health outreach program. The mobile unit will offer screening for breast cancer, cervical cancer, and osteoporosis as well as targeted health education. The partnership will aid data collection on women's health, including barriers to engaging the health care system, obstacles to referrals, as well as patterns and rates of disease. This joint project aims to develop policies that will better incorporate radiologic services into public health programs [24Mittra I. Breast cancer screening in developing countries.Prev Med. 2011; 53: 121-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar].To improve the interconnection between global radiology and public health, RAD-AID has also initiated a partnership with WHO. Initial efforts in Latin America are planned through WHO's Regional Office for the Americas, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). This pilot first aims to implement RAD-AID's Radiology-Readiness tool for participating Latin American and Caribbean hospitals through coordination with ministries of health, thus matching public health issues with optimized radiologic solutions.The radiology divide is also significantly affected by human resource disparities. The developing world has a scarcity of radiologists and medical imaging technologists. According to Pablo Jimenez, MD, regional advisor on radiologic health for PAHO and WHO, \u201cgeneral practitioners often have to make [imaging] interpretations and unqualified staff [are] performing x-ray exposures.\u201d Poor educational curricula, insufficient radiology educators, and ill-defined credentialing tracks exacerbate this human resource deficiency.Education Emphasizing Multidisciplinary TrainingEducational resources are a vital element of international radiologic service implementation and sustainability because of the advanced skills required for image acquisition and interpretation. The need for improved educational strategies is 2-fold: (1) educating personnel living in developed countries to serve in limited resource regions and (2) educating local health care providers living in the developing world to improve the quality of radiologic service [25Rabinowitz D.A. Pretorius E.S. Postgraduate radiology training in sub-Saharan Africa: a review of current educational resources.Acad Radiol. 2005; 12: 224-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar].Educating the US radiology community focuses on radiology residencies and academic medical centers as well as continuing medical education credits necessary for maintaining board certification. Although other medical and surgical specialties have incorporated international training into residency curricula, diagnostic radiology has yet to officially adopt international service into program requirements [6Welling R.D. Azene E.M. Kalia V. et al.White paper report of the 2010 RAD-AID Conference on International Radiology for Developing Countries: identifying sustainable strategies for imaging services in the developing world.J Am Coll Radiol. 2011; 8: 556-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 26Dey C.C. Grabowski J.G. Gebreyes K. Hsu E. VanRooyen M.J. Influence of international emergency medicine opportunities on residency program selection.Acad Emerg Med. 2002; 9: 679-683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Torjesen K. Mandalakas A. Kahn R. Duncan B. International child health electives for pediatric residents.Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med. 1999; 153: 1297-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 28Schultz S.H. Rousseau S. International health training in family practice residency programs.Fam Med. 1998; 30: 29-33PubMed Google Scholar]. Although there is a strong desire among radiology residents to participate in global service (as reflected by RAD-AID's published survey data [29Lungren M.P. Horvath J.J. Welling R.D. et al.Global health training in radiology residency programs.Acad Radiol. 2011; 18: 782-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar]) and a steadily growing demand for the ACR's Goldberg-Reeder Travel Grant, the supply of interested residents greatly exceeds the opportunities for international radiology experience. The RAD-AID conference consensus advocates structured supervised learning experiences for radiology residents with clearly defined educational milestones and work deliverables. Recent revision of the residency curriculum to accommodate new timing of the ABR certification examination may avail opportunities to incorporate international training. Ongoing efforts must address concerns about (1) liability and insurance coverage of traveling residents, (2) mechanisms for effective supervision and teaching of residents while abroad, and (3) workflow and salary coverage for residents on leave for international rotations.The radiology enterprise consists of a variety of skilled stakeholders with diverse expertise, including radiologists, radiologic technologists, radiology nurses, medical physicists, engineers, administrators, and IT specialists. Local health care personnel in low-income regions require training and educational materials developed through input from complementary professions. Consequently, the RAD-AID conference consensus advocates educational teams that blend specialized perspectives to create balanced strategies. Multidisciplinary teams have already been successfully implemented to improve efforts in CT dose reduction [30Goske M.J. Applegate K.E. Boylan J. et al.The \u201cImage Gently\u201d campaign: increasing CT radiation dose awareness through a national education and awareness program.Pediatr Radiol. 2008; 38: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar]. Given the importance of local health care personnel, translation of educational materials into culturally appropriate contexts and languages is also paramount. An example of this objective is RAD-AID's translation effort with WHO and PAHO of Radiology-Readiness for future assessments in Haiti and Latin America.RAD-AID's new partnerships with the Association for Radiologic and Imaging Nursing and the American Society of Radiologic Technologists (ASRT) reflect the goal of skill-set integration and complement long-standing partnerships with the ACR, RSNA, and Engineering World Health [31Malkin R.A. Design of health care technologies for the developing world.Annu Rev Biomed Eng. 2007; 9: 567-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar]. Historically, each specialized knowledge source offered international training independently, but recent trends favor interdisciplinary educational efforts. One manifestation of this trend is the RAD-AID conference provision of continuing education credits (via ASRT partnership) to technologists attending the annual meeting. Continuing education credits to other constituencies may be provided for future conferences.RAD-AID's 2010 Radiology-Readiness initiative in China, a collaboration between Project HOPE and RAD-AID, identified a great need for radiology education. This project began in 2011 with RAD-AID's support of radiologists presenting at the annual meetings of the Chinese Society of Radiologists. This model has expanded to include more subspecialty meetings of the Chinese Society of Radiologists and grand rounds presentations at leading urban hospitals, as well as efforts to improve and standardize the certification of radiology professionals throughout China. RAD-AID's China initiative has been published in the Chinese Journal of Radiology, which includes publication of US standards of radiology training for potential broader adoption in China [32Maxfield C. Grimm L. Chen J. Graduate radiology training in the United States.Chin J Radiol. 2011; 45Google Scholar]. Given that two-thirds of the world's poorest individuals (earning less than $1.25 per day) live in middle-income countries such as India and China, this radiology outreach initiative aims to address health care disparities affecting a large population.Clinical ModelsThe heterogeneity of cultural, geographic, economic, and health care contexts throughout the developing world necessitates the design and testing of multiple strategies for new imaging services. A successful radiology strategy in one region may or may not be adaptable to another community, country, or region. Therefore, the RAD-AID conference encourages dialog to evaluate ideas from multiple perspectives and to incorporate differences in experience among international service volunteers.Given ultrasound's high utility, versatility, and low cost, multiple models of ultrasound-based service have been implemented to assist developing countries [33Mindel S. Role of imager in developing world.Lancet. 1997; 350: 426-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar]. One model provides direct onsite instruction in goal-directed, point-of-care ultrasound to physicians. The Physicians Ultrasound in Rwanda Education initiative, administered by emergency medicine physicians, has partnered with the Rwandan government to design educational programs that fit the needs of their health care system. A second model trains midwives for obstetric screening at the point of care, implemented by the University of Washington in Uganda. A third model provides direct instruction to sonographers. For example, a sonography curriculum leading to American Registry for Diagnostic Medical Sonography certification in Ghana was presented at the 2009 RAD-AID conference by Ann Polin. A fourth model provides direct onsite instruction to nonphysicians in sonographic technique and interpretation, as presented by William Marks, MD, from pilot projects in Mali. A fifth model, initiated by Imaging the World in Uganda, trains personnel with little or no prior medical experience to perform regimented ultrasound protocol sweeps on the basis of physical landmarks with image transmission to a central facility for interpretation (Figure 2) . Finally, offsite instruction to health care providers visiting the United States is exemplified by the Jefferson University Research and Education Institute in the Teaching the Teachers program, as led and presented by Barry Goldberg at the 2009 and 2010 RAD-AID conferences [34Baltarowich O.H. Goldberg B.B. Wilkes A.N. Anane-Firempong A. Veloski J.J. Effectiveness of \u201cteaching the teachers\u201d initiative for ultrasound training in Africa.Acad Radiol. 2009; 16: 758-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar].Fig 2Imaging the World (ITW) data flow model for ultrasound (US) services in rural limited-resource regions showing transmission of Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) images from scanner to laptop and PACS to generate report via short message service (SMS) to local clinic.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)There are key similarities among these models that warrant attention and reflect radiology's progress in the developing world. First, these models place high importance on connected referral systems to further link care providers using ultrasound as a vital data point for triage. Second, these models emphasize peer education as a resource for replicating and transmitting knowledge among local personnel [35Shah S. Noble V.E. Umulisa I. et al.Development of an ultrasound training curriculum in a limited resource international setting: successes and challenges of ultrasound training in rural Rwanda.Int J Emerg Med. 2008; 1: 193-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar]. Third, these models often place clinical priority on maternal-infant health, with fetal ultrasound as a screening measure that may improve the management of obstetric deliveries [36Hofmeyr G.J. Routine ultrasound examination in early pregnancy: is it worthwhile in low-income countries?.Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol. 2009; 34: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar]. This emphasis highlights radiology's role in the global public health issue of maternal-infant mortality. Fourth, these models all emphasize the participation and collaboration among diverse stakeholders for executing these objectives.Breast imaging models presented at the RAD-AID conference also illustrate the range of approaches that can be implemented in the developing world. Direct onsite multidisciplinary instruction in stationary mammographic facilities is advocated by Richard Hirsh, MD, of Radiology Mammography International, with project evidence from Asia and Latin America. RAD-AID's initiative in northern India uses mobile imaging linked with tertiary care center referral services to serve marginalized populations. Combining screening interventions and targeted health education can potentially improve health care for women living in slums and rural regions in a cost-effective manner [37Kim J.J. Salomon J.A. Weinstein M.C. Goldie S.J. Packaging health services when resources are limited: the example of a cervical cancer screening visit.PLoS Med. 2006; 3: e434Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar].Although numerous other models and projects are under way throughout the world, the examples presented at the 2011 RAD-AID conference provide solutions to personnel shortages and educational challenges that remain major barriers to international radiologic service. These solutions will be further discussed, refined, and optimized in the future.Technology InnovationThe role of technology innovation is paramount in radiology's international outreach, because novel technologies can improve quality, optimize connectivity, and decrease cost of services. Examples of technology innovation include imaging services and educational platforms used to support personnel. The continuing proliferation of third-generation cell networks, broadband Internet, and Wi-Fi present new opportunities for digitally connecting radiology facilities in the developing world. Imaging the World, for example, advocates a unique image compression technique to facilitate ultrasound transmission to remote diagnostic centers. Moreover, RAD-AID advocates cloud-based PACS for low-cost image storage that can also facilitate interinstitutional consultations, educational case rounds, and direct radiologic service.The proliferation of smartphone technologies allows new opportunities in imaging. Brian Choi, MD, of George Washington University, presented a model for smartphone-based echocardiography at the 2011 RAD-AID conference. More than 80% of cardiovascular deaths occur in low-income and middle-income countries, where echocardiography is scarce and could be lifesaving [38Kishore S.P. Vedanthan R. Fuster V.

Armed with these tools, the emergency radiologist can detect pelvic fractures early and guide subsequent imaging and therapy."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W3155257048", "relevance_score": 264.9876, "publication_year": 2021, "title": "Errors, discrepancies and underlying bias in radiology with case examples: a pictorial review", "cited_by_count": 26, "concepts": [{"display_name": "CLARITY", "level": 2, "score": 0.8203596}, {"display_name": "Neuroradiology", "level": 3, "score": 0.68375117}, {"display_name": "Interventional radiology", "level": 2, "score": 0.64260465}, {"display_name": "Harm", "level": 2, "score": 0.5884522}, {"display_name": "Interpretation (philosophy)", "level": 2, "score": 0.58352995}, {"display_name": "Medical physics", "level": 1, "score": 0.49907708}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.46921077}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Abstract": [0], "Interpretation": [1], "differences": [2], "between": [3], "radiologists": [4], "and": [5, 19, 29, 46, 54, 61, 67], "diagnostic": [6, 27], "errors": [7, 18, 45], "are": [8, 52], "significant": [9], "issues": [10], "in": [11], "daily": [12], "radiology": [13], "practice.": [14], "An": [15], "awareness": [16], "of": [17, 35, 44, 59], "their": [20], "underlying": [21, 48], "causes": [22], "can": [23], "potentially": [24], "increase": [25], "the": [26, 42, 47], "performance": [28], "reduce": [30], "individual": [31], "harm.": [32], "The": [33], "aim": [34], "this": [36], "paper": [37], "is": [38], "to": [39, 63], "review": [40], "both": [41], "classification": [43], "biases.": [49], "Case-based": [50], "examples": [51], "presented": [53], "discussed": [55], "for": [56], "each": [57], "type": [58], "error": [60], "bias": [62], "provide": [64], "greater": [65], "clarity": [66], "understanding.": [68]}, "authors": ["\u00d6mer \u00d6nder", "Yasin Yara\u015f\u0131r", "Aynur Azizova", "Gamze Durhan", "Mehmet Ruhi Onur", "Orhan Macit Ar\u0131y\u00fcrek"], "abstract": "Abstract Interpretation differences between radiologists and diagnostic errors are significant issues in daily radiology practice.

This article is the first in a series of four that summarize how some of the knowledge gained from other fields might be used to improve patient safety and quality in interventional radiology. Before starting, it is worthwhile to state that, although millions of patients have derived tremendous benefit from the dedicated efforts of thousands of interventional radiology teams, we can clearly do better. Improving patient safety and quality will always be a continuous process that revolves around two fundamental questions. First, how might a particular procedure fail to provide the predicted benefit? Second, how can we change our current process so as to increase the probability of success in the future?"}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2321315897", "relevance_score": 216.48901, "publication_year": 2016, "title": "Overview of the Full-scale Radiological Dispersal Device Field Trials", "cited_by_count": 26, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Radiological weapon", "level": 2, "score": 0.722841}, {"display_name": "Biological dispersal", "level": 3, "score": 0.7087156}, {"display_name": "Field trial", "level": 2, "score": 0.5818972}, {"display_name": "Scale (ratio)", "level": 2, "score": 0.49733928}, {"display_name": "Field (mathematics)", "level": 2, "score": 0.4816455}, {"display_name": "Medical physics", "level": 1, "score": 0.38672274}, {"display_name": "Environmental resource management", "level": 1, "score": 0.32384688}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"In": [0], "2012,": [1], "Defence": [2], "Research": [3], "and": [4, 15, 69, 83, 100, 118, 126, 140], "Development": [5], "Canada,": [6], "in": [7, 65, 78], "partnership": [8], "with": [9], "a": [10, 19, 28, 48, 62, 79, 112], "number": [11], "of": [12, 21, 47, 88, 102, 114, 130], "other": [13], "Canadian": [14], "International": [16], "organizations,": [17], "led": [18], "series": [20], "three": [22, 123], "field": [23], "trials": [24, 90], "designed": [25], "to": [26, 71, 136], "simulate": [27], "Radiological": [29], "Dispersal": [30], "Device": [31], "(RDD).": [32], "These": [33], "trials,": [34, 104], "known": [35], "as": [36], "the": [37, 44, 85, 89, 98, 103, 106, 115, 122, 131, 138], "Full-Scale": [38], "RDD": [39], "(FSRDD)": [40], "Field": [41, 59], "Trials,": [42], "involved": [43], "explosive": [45], "dispersal": [46, 124], "short-lived": [49], "radioactive": [50], "tracer": [51], "(140La,": [52], "t1/2": [53], "=": [54], "40.293": [55], "h).": [56], "The": [57, 93], "FSRDD": [58], "Trials": [60], "required": [61], "significant": [63], "effort": [64], "their": [66], "planning,": [67], "preparation,": [68], "execution": [70, 101], "ensure": [72], "that": [73, 84, 133], "they": [74], "were": [75, 91, 134], "carried": [76], "out": [77], "safe,": [80], "efficient": [81], "manner": [82], "scientific": [86], "goals": [87], "met.": [92], "discussion": [94], "presented": [95], "here": [96], "details": [97], "planning": [99], "outlines": [105], "relevant": [107], "radiation": [108], "safety": [109], "aspects,": [110], "provides": [111, 127], "summary": [113], "source": [116], "term": [117], "atmospheric": [119], "conditions": [120], "for": [121], "events,": [125], "an": [128], "overview": [129], "measurements": [132], "made": [135], "track": [137], "plumes": [139], "deposition": [141], "patterns.": [142]}, "authors": ["Anna Rae Green", "Lorne Erhardt", "Luke S.

While this tumor entity is associated with poor prognosis in children, clinical experience in adults remains limited.Patient demographics, radiologic and pathologic characteristics, treatment course, progression, and patient survival were collected for 60 adult patients with DMG, H3 K27M-mutant. A subset of tumors also underwent next-generation sequencing. Analysis of progression-free survival and overall survival was conducted using Kaplan-Meier modeling, and univariate and multivariate analysis.Median patient age was 32 years (range 18-71 years). Tumors were centered in the thalamus (n = 34), spinal cord (10), brainstem (5), cerebellum (4), or other midline sites (4), or were multifocal (3). Genomic profiling revealed p.K27M mutations exclusively in the H3F3A gene and an absence of mutations in HIST1H3B or HIST1H3C, which are present in approximately one-third of pediatric DMGs. Accompanying mutations in TP53, PPM1D, FGFR1, NF1, and ATRX were frequently found. The overall survival of this adult cohort was 27.6 months, longer than historical averages for both H3 K27M-mutant DMG in children and IDH-wildtype glioblastoma in adults.Together, these findings indicate that H3 K27M-mutant DMG represents a heterogeneous disease with regard to outcomes, sites of origin, and molecular pathogenesis in adults versus children."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W1991601382", "relevance_score": 215.88846, "publication_year": 2010, "title": "Methods of determining the effective dose in dental radiology", "cited_by_count": 26, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Effective dose (radiation)", "level": 2, "score": 0.5714172}, {"display_name": "Cone beam computed tomography", "level": 3, "score": 0.55074656}, {"display_name": "Radiation dose", "level": 2, "score": 0.52298594}, {"display_name": "Reliability (semiconductor)", "level": 3, "score": 0.5063528}, {"display_name": "Medical physics", "level": 1, "score": 0.4720272}, {"display_name": "Nuclear medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.44149664}, {"display_name": "Collective dose", "level": 3, "score": 0.42715752}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.4132852}, {"display_name": "Computed tomography", "level": 2, "score": 0.37398812}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"A": [0], "wide": [1], "variety": [2], "of": [3, 28, 37, 52, 78, 120, 127, 139, 150, 186], "X-ray": [4], "equipment": [5, 156], "is": [6, 47, 57, 65, 83, 122], "used": [7, 158, 174], "today": [8], "in": [9, 50, 99, 159, 183], "dental": [10, 160], "radiology,": [11, 161], "including": [12], "intra-oral,": [13], "orthopantomographic,": [14], "cephalometric,": [15], "cone-beam": [16], "computed": [17, 21], "tomography": [18, 22], "(CBCT)": [19], "and": [20, 63, 130, 162, 176, 180], "(CT).": [23], "This": [24, 94], "raises": [25], "the": [26, 30, 45, 79, 101, 107, 118, 125, 128, 148, 151, 155, 184, 187], "question": [27], "how": [29], "radiation": [31, 132], "risks": [32], "resulting": [33], "from": [34, 154], "different": [35, 72, 145], "kinds": [36], "examinations": [38], "should": [39], "be": [40], "compared.": [41], "The": [42, 76, 137, 167], "risk": [43], "to": [44, 59, 67, 97, 143, 163], "patient": [46], "usually": [48], "expressed": [49], "terms": [51], "effective": [53, 152, 188], "dose.": [54, 189], "However,": [55], "it": [56, 64], "difficult": [58, 66], "determine": [60], "its": [61], "reliability,": [62], "make": [68], "comparisons,": [69], "especially": [70, 105], "when": [71, 106], "modalities": [73], "are": [74, 88, 135, 169], "used.": [75, 136], "classification": [77], "new": [80], "CBCT": [81], "units": [82], "also": [84], "problematic": [85], "as": [86, 91, 117], "they": [87], "sometimes": [89], "classified": [90], "CT": [92], "units.": [93], "will": [95], "lead": [96], "problems": [98], "choosing": [100], "best": [102], "dosimetric": [103], "method,": [104], "examination": [108], "geometry": [109], "resembles": [110], "more": [111], "on": [112, 172], "an": [113], "ordinary": [114], "orthopantomographic": [115], "examination,": [116], "axis": [119], "rotation": [121], "not": [123], "at": [124], "centre": [126], "patient,": [129], "small": [131], "field": [133], "sizes": [134], "purpose": [138], "this": [140], "study": [141], "was": [142], "present": [144], "methods": [146, 168], "for": [147], "estimation": [149, 185], "dose": [153, 178], "currently": [157], "discuss": [164], "their": [165, 181], "limitations.": [166], "compared": [170], "based": [171], "commonly": [173], "measurable": [175], "computable": [177], "quantities,": [179], "reliability": [182]}, "authors": ["Anne Thilander-Klang", "Ebba Helmrot"], "abstract": "A wide variety of X-ray equipment is used today in dental radiology, including intra-oral, orthopantomographic, cephalometric, cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) and computed tomography (CT).

However, it is difficult to determine its reliability, and it is difficult to make comparisons, especially when different modalities are used. The classification of the new CBCT units is also problematic as they are sometimes classified as CT units. This will lead to problems in choosing the best dosimetric method, especially when the examination geometry resembles more on an ordinary orthopantomographic examination, as the axis of rotation is not at the centre of the patient, and small radiation field sizes are used.

Some techniques were described in the literature but required many years to enter the clinical arena and presently continue to expand in terms of clinical application.

Presenting problems were sepsis, jaundice, and intermittent cholangitis. The patients underwent 104 interventional radiologic procedures including 29 percutaneous transhepatic cholangiograms, 21 percutaneous biliary drainages, 12 balloon dilatations of strictures, drainage of 11 abscesses, 8 bilomas, 5 hematomas, and 3 pancreatic pseudocysts. Stones were removed by baskets in 2 patients; 12 pressure and perfusion studies were performed. One hundred of 104 procedures were successful; there was one failed biliary drainage, one unsuccessful stricture dilatation, one unsuccessful hematoma drainage, and one recurrent biloma. Thirty patients were spared another operation. The percutaneous procedures were beneficial although not curative in 14 of 15 patients who underwent reoperation; in those patients the procedures helped to establish a diagnosis, improve the patient's preoperative status, or serve as a landmark for the surgeon to locate and repair the ligated or injured duct. One patient died after reoperation, a 2.2% mortality rate.

Assessing NLP performance is a prerequisite for downstream tasks and therefore of importance from a clinical perspective (avoiding missed injuries, quality check, insight in diagnostic yield) as well as from a research perspective (identification of patient cohorts, annotation of radiographs). Datasets of Dutch radiology reports of injured extremities (n = 2469, 33% fractures) and chest radiographs (n = 799, 20% pneumothorax) were collected in two different hospitals and labeled by radiologists and trauma surgeons for the presence or absence of injuries. NLP classification was applied and optimized by testing different preprocessing steps and different classifiers (Rule-based, ML, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)). Performance was assessed by F1-score, AUC, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. The deep learning based BERT model outperforms all other classification methods which were assessed. The model achieved an F1-score of (95 \u00b1 2)% and accuracy of (96 \u00b1 1)% on a dataset of simple reports (n= 2469), and an F1 of (83 \u00b1 7)% with accuracy (93 \u00b1 2)% on a dataset of complex reports (n= 799).

A radiomorphologic classification based on the relationship between the facial sinus and the mastoid portion of the facial nerve is created as follows. In type A facial sinus, the pneumatization of the facial sinus did not extend medially or posteriorly to the mastoid portion of the facial nerve. In type B facial sinus, the pneumatization extended posteriorly to the mastoid portion of the facial nerve. In type C facial sinus, the pneumatization extended posteriorly and medially to the mastoid portion of the facial nerve.In all the specimens that underwent HRCT (n = 31), facial sinus could be identified, and its depth classified, in relation to the facial nerve. In this group, 58% type A, 29% type B, and 13% type C facial sinuses were identified. In all the specimens (n = 39), the facial sinus could be assessed by means of an exclusive endoscopic transcanal approach, and anatomical variants of the chordiculus, previously known as chordal ridge, could be described: ridge (39%), bridge (18%), incomplete (15%), and absent (28%).Endoscopic exploration of the retrotympanum guarantees a very good exposure of the facial sinus, allowing detailed anatomic descriptions of its conformation and relationships with other structures. Improvement in our knowledge of its anatomy might decrease the possibility of residual disease during cholesteatoma surgery. Angled endoscopes (e.g. 45 \u00b0, 70 \u00b0) can guarantee a better view of the facial sinus.NA.

Institutional committees are under increasing pressure to rank applicants based on previous achievements for appointments/promotions, funding, and awards, and must do so within unforgiving time constraints. The journal impact factor (IF) has been loosely adopted in many circles for assessing article \u201cquality,\u201d circumventing detailed review of individual articles. The premise supporting such practice often hinges on assuming that high-IF journals are harder to publish in, for example, have higher rejection rates (RRs), and therefore, authors achieving publication in such periodicals should be \u201crecognized\u201d for their achievement. There is no evidence of previous research linking IF and RR. Materials and Methods A subset of Institute for Scientific Information (ISI)-listed radiology journals, for which IF data were available, was identified and a direct-contact survey approach (63.3% response rate) used to ascertain journal manuscript RR. Results Of the sample reviewed, the ISI-listed IF values ranged from 4.759 to 0.056 (mean 1.491), and editor-reported manuscript RRs from 80.0% to 8.0% (mean 47.8%). Statistical comparison of IF and RR using linear regression yielded an r 2 value of 0.223. Conclusions In summary, this study demonstrates poor linear agreement between IF and RR for manuscripts submitted to peer-reviewed radiology journals. This suggests that journal IF is a poor predictor of RR, and vice versa. This finding may be of interest to institutional committees who have adopted the IF as an indicator of merit in reviewing publication curriculum vitae, and may encourage rethinking of currently practiced candidate assessment approaches.

Methods In 84 dry human skulls, imaging studies were performed (64-slice computed tomography [CT] scanner, axial view, aligned with the zygomatic arch). Optic strut location related to the prechiasmatic sulcus was classified as presulcal, sulcal, postsulcal, and asymmetric. Morphometric analysis was performed. Results The optic strut was presulcal in 11.9% specimens (posteromedial margin bilaterally anterior to limbus sphenoidale), sulcal in 44% (posteromedial part adjacent to the sulcus's anterior two thirds bilaterally), postsulcal in 29.8% (posteromedial margin posterior to the sulcus's anterior two thirds), and asymmetric (left/right) in 14.3%. Optic strut length, width, and thickness measured 6.54 \u00b1 1.69 mm, 4.23 \u00b1 0.69 mm, and 3.01 \u00b1 0.79 mm, respectively. Optic canal diameter was 5.14 \u00b1 0.47 mm anteriorly and 4.79 \u00b1 0.64 mm posteriorly. Angulation was flat (>45 degrees) in 13% or acute (<45 degrees) in 87% specimens.

However, little is known about clinical predictors of disease severity. We studied the clinical predictors of severe pandemic H1N1 pneumonia and their correlation with radiological findings. Methods We reviewed medical and radiological records of adults with pandemic H1N1 pneumonia. After classification of patients into severe and non-severe groups, the following data were evaluated: demographic data, pneumonia severity index (PSI), CURB65, risk factors, time to first dose of antiviral medication, routine laboratory data, clinical outcome, and radiological characteristics. Results Of 37 patients with pandemic H1N1 pneumonia, 12 and 25 were assigned to the severe and non-severe groups, respectively. PSI score, serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and lactate dyhydrogenase (LDH) levels were higher in the severe group than in the non-severe group (p = 0.035, 0.0003, 0.0023, and 0.0002, respectively). AST, ALT, and LDH levels were positively correlated with the radiological findings (p < 0.0001, 0.0003, and < 0.0001, respectively) and with the number of involved lobes (p = 0.663, 0.0134, and 0.0019, respectively). The most common finding on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans was ground-glass attenuation with consolidation (n = 22, 60%), which had a predominantly patchy distribution (n = 31). Conclusions We demonstrated a positive correlation between clinical findings, such as serum AST, ALT, and LDH levels, and radiological findings.

We used the Internet to help promote the creation of teaching files in a more timely, efficient, and effective manner."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2751469357", "relevance_score": 176.56122, "publication_year": 2017, "title": "Clinical features and radiological findings of 67 patients with SAPHO syndrome", "cited_by_count": 26, "concepts": [{"display_name": "SAPHO syndrome", "level": 5, "score": 0.9974715}, {"display_name": "Pustulosis", "level": 4, "score": 0.92448086}, {"display_name": "Hyperostosis", "level": 2, "score": 0.91294646}, {"display_name": "Palmoplantar pustulosis", "level": 3, "score": 0.88344145}, {"display_name": "Osteitis", "level": 3, "score": 0.80567265}, {"display_name": "Synovitis", "level": 3, "score": 0.66909796}, {"display_name": "Acne", "level": 2, "score": 0.6486874}, {"display_name": "Enthesitis", "level": 4, "score": 0.5882365}, {"display_name": "Radiological weapon", "level": 2, "score": 0.5113334}, {"display_name": "Dermatology", "level": 1, "score": 0.50399107}, {"display_name": "Psoriasis", "level": 2, "score": 0.4687581}, {"display_name": "Psoriatic arthritis", "level": 3, "score": 0.35093302}, {"display_name": "Radiology", "level": 1, "score": 0.32033235}, {"display_name": "Arthritis", "level": 2, "score": 0.26495823}, {"display_name": "Osteomyelitis", "level": 2, "score": 0.26224697}, {"display_name": "Surgery", "level": 1, "score": 0.2584415}, {"display_name": "Internal medicine", "level": 1, "score": 0.22847593}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"Objectives:": [0], "The": [1, 160], "purpose": [2], "of": [3, 11, 28, 64, 100, 120, 173, 189, 198, 205], "this": [4], "study": [5], "was": [6, 88, 103, 123], "to": [7, 54], "facilitate": [8], "the": [9, 12, 23, 72, 95, 101, 104, 121, 138, 167, 171, 174, 187, 196, 199, 203], "understanding": [10], "SAPHO": [13, 33, 50, 152, 192, 200], "(Synovitis,": [14], "Acne,": [15], "Pustulosis,": [16], "Hyperostosis,": [17], "and": [18, 25, 61, 84, 94, 108, 157, 170, 181], "Osteitis)": [19], "syndrome": [20, 51, 153], "by": [21], "analyzing": [22], "clinical": [24, 156, 161], "radiological": [26, 62, 158], "features": [27, 162], "67": [29, 73], "Japanese": [30, 37], "patients": [31, 38, 66, 135, 149, 190], "with": [32, 49, 191, 202], "syndrome.": [34, 193], "Methods:": [35], "Sixty-seven": [36], "(female/male:": [39], "44/23,": [40], "mean": [41], "age": [42], "at": [43, 56], "onset:": [44], "48.5": [45], "years)": [46], "were": [47, 67, 115, 131, 145, 163, 183], "diagnosed": [48], "from": [52, 111], "2002": [53], "2013": [55], "our": [57], "hospital.": [58], "Medical": [59], "records": [60], "imaging": [63], "these": [65], "retrospectively": [68], "reviewed.": [69], "Results:": [70], "Among": [71], "patients,": [74, 93], "41": [75], "had": [76, 154], "dermatological": [77, 168], "manifestations,": [78], "such": [79], "as": [80], "palmoplantar": [81], "pustulosis,": [82], "acne,": [83], "psoriasis.": [85], "Initial": [86], "symptom": [87, 102], "local": [89], "pain": [90], "in": [91, 126, 133, 147, 186], "all": [92, 116, 127], "most": [96], "common": [97], "initial": [98], "site": [99], "anterior": [105, 175], "chest.": [106, 176], "Bacterial": [107], "fungal": [109], "cultures": [110], "20": [112], "bone": [113, 207], "biopsies": [114], "negative.": [117], "Histopathological": [118], "diagnosis": [119], "specimens": [122], "non-specific": [124], "inflammation": [125], "cases.": [128], "Bone": [129, 177], "lesions": [130, 142, 178], "observed": [132], "65": [134], "(97.0%).": [136], "On": [137], "other": [139, 206], "hand,": [140], "articular": [141], "including": [143, 179], "enthesitis": [144], "found": [146, 184], "31": [148], "(46.2%).": [150], "Conclusion:": [151], "different": [155], "aspects.": [159], "not": [164], "remarkable,": [165], "except": [166], "manifestations": [169], "involvement": [172], "hyperostosis": [180], "osteitis": [182], "radiographically": [185], "majority": [188], "These": [194], "are": [195], "characteristics": [197], "syndrome,": [201], "exclusion": [204], "diseases.": [208]}, "authors": ["Hiroshi Okuno", "Munenori Watanuki", "Yoshiyuki Kuwahara", "Akira Sekiguchi", "Yu Mori", "Shin Hitachi", "Kiyomi Miura", "Ken Ogura", "Mika Watanabe", "Masami Hosaka", "Masahito Hatori", "Eiji Itoi", "Katsumi Sato"], "abstract": "Objectives: The purpose of this study was to facilitate the understanding of the SAPHO (Synovitis, Acne, Pustulosis, Hyperostosis, and Osteitis) syndrome by analyzing the clinical and radiological features of 67 Japanese patients with SAPHO syndrome. Methods: Sixty-seven Japanese patients (female/male: 44/23, mean age at onset: 48.5 years) were diagnosed with SAPHO syndrome from 2002 to 2013 at our hospital. Medical records and radiological imaging of these patients were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Among the 67 patients, 41 had dermatological manifestations, such as palmoplantar pustulosis, acne, and psoriasis. Initial symptom was local pain in all patients, and the most common initial site of the symptom was the anterior chest. Bacterial and fungal cultures from 20 bone biopsies were all negative. Histopathological diagnosis of the specimens was non-specific inflammation in all cases. Bone lesions were observed in 65 patients (97.0%). On the other hand, articular lesions including enthesitis were found in 31 patients (46.2%). Conclusion: SAPHO syndrome had different clinical and radiological aspects. The clinical features were not remarkable, except the dermatological manifestations and the involvement of the anterior chest. Bone lesions including hyperostosis and osteitis were found radiographically in the majority of patients with SAPHO syndrome. These are the characteristics of the SAPHO syndrome, with the exclusion of other bone diseases."}, {"id": "https://openalex.org/W2039259565", "relevance_score": 173.56534, "publication_year": 2011, "title": "Surgical Management of Ipsilateral Fracture of the Femur and Tibia in Adults (the Floating Knee): Postoperative Clinical, Radiological, and Functional Outcomes", "cited_by_count": 26, "concepts": [{"display_name": "Intramedullary rod", "level": 2, "score": 0.954592}, {"display_name": "Tibia", "level": 2, "score": 0.6526592}, {"display_name": "Radiological weapon", "level": 2, "score": 0.65025127}, {"display_name": "Condyle", "level": 2, "score": 0.6343281}, {"display_name": "Surgery", "level": 1, "score": 0.6319344}, {"display_name": "Femur", "level": 2, "score": 0.61783695}, {"display_name": "Polytrauma", "level": 2, "score": 0.4230681}], "abstract_inverted_index": {"This": [0], "study": [1], "evaluated": [2], "the": [3, 42, 109, 143, 155], "outcomes": [4], "of": [5, 8, 104, 127, 142, 153], "surgical": [6], "management": [7, 141], "ipsilateral": [9], "femoral": [10], "and": [11, 73, 87, 125, 157], "tibial": [12], "fractures": [13, 36, 61, 75, 156], "in": [14, 32, 135], "adults.Fifteen": [15], "patients": [16], "(13": [17], "men,": [18], "2": [19], "women;": [20], "mean": [21, 92], "age,": [22], "34.8": [23], "years;": [24], "range,": [25], "18": [26], "to": [27, 41, 100, 108], "65": [28], "years)": [29], "were": [30, 38, 62, 76], "enrolled": [31], "this": [33], "study.": [34], "The": [35, 91, 139], "types": [37], "classified": [39], "according": [40, 107], "classification": [43], "by": [44], "Fraser": [45], "et": [46], "al.": [47], "as": [48, 113], "follows:": [49, 114], "type": [50, 53, 126], "I": [51], "(5),": [52], "IIa": [54], "(3),": [55], "IIb": [56], "(4),": [57], "IIc": [58], "(3).": [59], "Femur": [60], "treated": [63, 77], "using": [64], "locked": [65, 88], "intramedullary": [66, 89, 151], "nails,": [67], "plate-screws,": [68, 86], "or": [69, 85], "dynamic": [70], "condylar": [71], "screws,": [72], "tibia": [74], "with": [78], "an": [79], "external": [80], "fixator": [81], "(in": [82], "open": [83], "fractures),": [84], "nailing.": [90], "follow-up": [93], "duration": [94], "was": [95, 112], "2.2": [96], "years": [97], "(range,": [98], "1.3": [99], "4": [101], "years).The": [102], "extent": [103], "bony": [105], "union": [106], "Karlstrom": [110], "criteria": [111], "excellent,": [115], "8;": [116], "good,": [117], "4;": [118], "acceptable,": [119], "2;": [120], "poor,": [121], "1.The": [122], "associated": [123, 144], "injuries": [124, 145], "fracture": [128], "(open,": [129], "intra-articular,": [130], "comminution)": [131], "are": [132], "prognostic": [133], "factors": [134], "a": [136], "floating": [137], "knee.": [138], "best": [140], "for": [146], "good": [147], "final": [148], "outcome": [149], "involves": [150], "nailing": [152], "both": [154], "postoperative": [158], "rehabilitation.": [159]}, "authors": ["Alaa M.

Femur fractures were treated using locked intramedullary nails, plate-screws, or dynamic condylar screws, and tibia fractures were treated with an external fixator (in open fractures), or plate-screws, and locked intramedullary nailing. The mean follow-up duration was 2.2 years (range, 1.3 to 4 years).The extent of bony union according to the Karlstrom criteria was as follows: excellent, 8; good, 4; acceptable, 2; poor, 1.The associated injuries and type of fracture (open, intra-articular, comminution) are prognostic factors in a floating knee. The best management of the associated injuries for good final outcome involves intramedullary nailing of both the fractures and postoperative rehabilitation."}]}
