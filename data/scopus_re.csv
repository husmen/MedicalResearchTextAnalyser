Applications of deep learning and other AI approaches must be guided by sound medical knowledge to assure that they are developed successfully and that they address important problems in biomedical research or patient care. To date, AI has been applied to a limited number of real-world radiology applications. As AI systems become more pervasive and are applied more broadly, they will benefit from medical knowledge on a larger scale, such as that available through computer-based approaches. A key approach to represent computer-based knowledge in a particular domain is an ontology. As defined in informatics, an ontology defines a domain’s terms through their relationships with other terms in the ontology. Those relationships, then, define the terms’ semantics, or “meaning.” Biomedical ontologies commonly define the relationships between terms and more general terms, and can express causal, part-whole, and anatomic relationships. Ontologies express knowledge in a form that is both human-readable and machine-computable. Some ontologies, such as RSNA’s RadLex radiology lexicon, have been applied to applications in clinical practice and research, and may be familiar to many radiologists. This article describes how ontologies can support research and guide emerging applications of AI in radiology, including natural language processing, image–based machine learning, radiomics, and planning. © 2021, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine.","Artificial intelligence; Controlled vocabulary; Knowledge representation; Ontology; Terminology","Artificial Intelligence; Biological Ontologies; Humans; Natural Language Processing; Radiography; Radiology; Clinical research; Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Medical imaging; Medical problems; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Radiation; Radiology; Semantics; Artificial intelligence systems; Biomedical ontologies; Biomedical research; Computer-based approach; Knowledge-representation; Large-scales; Medical knowledge; Ontology's; Patient care; Real-world; artificial intelligence; biological ontology; human; natural language processing; radiography; radiology; Knowledge representation","Review","Scopus"

DL utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNN) and may be used to classify imaging features. The objective of this literature review is to summarize recent publications highlighting the key ways in which ML and DL may be applied in radiology, along with solutions to the problems that this implementation may face. Material and methods: Twenty-one publications were selected from the primary literature through a PubMed search. The articles included in our review studied a range of applications of artificial intelligence in radiology. Results: The implementation of artificial intelligence in diagnostic and interventional radiology may improve image analysis, aid in diagnosis, as well as suggest appropriate interventions, clinical predictive modelling, and trainee education. Potential challenges include ethical concerns and the need for appropriate datasets with accurate labels and large sample sizes to train from. Additionally, the training data should be representative of the population to which the future ML platform will be applicable. Finally, machines do not disclose a statistical rationale when expounding on the task purpose, making them difficult to apply in medical imaging. Conclusions: As radiologists report increased workload, utilization of artificial intelligence may provide improved outcomes in medical imaging by assisting, rather than guiding or replacing, radiologists. Further research should be done on the risks of AI implementation and how to most accurately validate the results. © Pol J Radiol 2022.","Artificial intelligence; Imaging; Machine learning; Radiology","artificial intelligence; climate model; deep learning; diagnostic imaging; education; human; human experiment; image analysis; interventional radiology; machine learning; Medline; radiologist; review; sample size; systematic review; workload","Review","Scopus"

Another point is that AI can handle large data sets in high-dimensional spaces. But it should not be forgotten that AI is only as good as the training samples available, which should ideally be numerous enough to cover all variants. On the other hand, the main feature of human intelligence is content knowledge and the ability to find near-optimal solutions. The purpose of this paper is to review the current complexity of radiology working places, to describe their advantages and shortcomings. Further, we give an AI overview of the different types and features as used so far. We also touch on the differences between AI and human intelligence in problem-solving. We present a new AI type, labeled “explainable AI,” which should enable a balance/cooperation between AI and human intelligence — thus bringing both worlds in compliance with legal requirements.

There are increasing expectations for radiology practices to deliver a dedicated emergency radiology service providing 24/7/365 on-site attending radiologist coverage. Emergency radiologists (ERs) are pressed to meet the demand of increased imaging volume, provide accurate reports, maintain a lower proportion of discrepancy rate, and with a rapid report turnaround time of finalized reports. Thus, rendering the radiologists overburdened. The demand for an increased efficiency in providing quality care to acute patients has led to the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field. AI can be used to assist emergency and trauma radiologists deal with the ever-increasing imaging volume and workload, as AI methods have typically demonstrated a variety of applications in medical image analysis and interpretation, albeit most programs are in a training or validation phase. This article aims to offer an evidence-based discourse about the evolving role of artificial intelligence in assisting the imaging pathway in an emergency and trauma radiology department. We hope to generate a multidisciplinary discourse that addresses the technical processes, the challenges in the labour-intensive process of training, validation and testing of an algorithm, the need for emphasis on ethics, and how an emergency radiologist’s role is pivotal in the execution of AI-guided systems within the context of an emergency and trauma radiology department. This exploratory narrative serves the present-day health leadership’s information needs by proposing an AI supported and radiologist centered framework depicting the work flow within a department. It is suspected that the use of such a framework, if efficacious, could provide considerable benefits for patient safety and quality of care provided.

This study systematically reviews the trends and applications of NLP in radiology within the last five years. Methods: A search of three databases of peer-reviewed journal articles and conference papers from January 1, 2016 to April 21, 2021 resulted in a total of 228 publications included in the review. Manuscripts were analyzed by several factors, including clinical application, study setting, NLP technique, and performance. Results: Of the 228 included publications, there was an overall increase in number of studies published with an increase in use of machine learning models. NLP models showed high performance: >50% of publications reported F1 > 0.91. There was variable sample size across the studies with a median of 3708 data points, most commonly radiology reports. 145 studies utilized data from a single academic center. Applications were classified as clinical (n = 87), technical (n = 66), quality improvement (n = 61), research (n = 9), and education (n = 5). Discussion: There has been a continued increase in number of studies involving NLP in radiology. Newer NLP techniques, including word embedding, deep learning, and transformers, are being applied and show improved performance. There has been growth in the interpretative and non-interpretative use of NLP techniques in radiology and has great capacity to improve patient care and delivery. Although the performance and breadth of NLP applications is impressive, there is an overall lack of high-level evidence for actual clinical application of published tools. Conclusion: NLP applications in radiology has been increasing studied and more accurate in the last 5 years. More direct clinical application and portability of the NLP pipelines is need to reach the technology's full potential. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial Intelligence; Natural Language Processing; Radiology; Systematic Review","Data Management; Humans; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Radiography; Radiology; Clinical research; Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Publishing; Radiation; Radiology; Application studies; Clinical application; Conference papers; Journal articles; Language processing techniques; Machine learning models; Natural language processing applications; Performance; Processing performance; Systematic Review; adult; artificial intelligence; deep learning; education; embedding; female; human; machine learning; male; natural language processing; patient care; pipeline; radiology; review; sample size; systematic review; total quality management; information processing; radiography; Natural language processing systems","Review","Scopus"

We investigated the advantages of using a radiology information system as the primary data source for a mammographic patient-tracking system that is based on a personal-computer local-area network and that requires almost no data entry. HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE. Our mammographic data base is maintained on a file server that provides cross-platform access to both MacIntosh and IBM-compatible personal computers. Locally developed software automatically transfers mammographic data from our radiology information system to the file server's mammographic data base. The data transferred include patients' demographics (e.g., hospital identification number, address, referring physician) and the complete mammographic report. With the use of specific terminology, the need for follow-up can be automatically gleaned from the mammographic report and coded within the data base. Graphically oriented, commercially available software provides easy access to this information from any personal computer on our department's network. The software provides considerable flexibility for searching and manipulating the data without the need for customized data-base programming. Redundant data entry and associated errors are drastically reduced, as are personnel requirements for maintaining the system. Relative to most commercial radiology information systems, a personal computer facilitates the steps involved in tracking patients and obtaining highly customized analyses of the mammographic data base. The data in the mammographic data base exactly match those in the hospital's registration data and are easily transferred to other personal-computer programs for ancillary processing. CONCLUSION. This technique is ideal for departments that use a general-purpose radiology information system for mammographic reporting, yet need a more powerful but user-friendly and low-cost method for tracking their mammography patients.","","computer program; computer system; data base; human; information retrieval; information system; mammography; medical record; microcomputer; patient coding; priority journal; radiology; review","Review","Scopus"

It is being developed and supported by many national and international radiology societies, based on the recognised need to use uniform language and structure to accurately describe radiology findings. Standardisation of report structures ensures that all relevant areas are addressed. Standardisation of terminology prevents ambiguity in reports and facilitates comparability of reports. The use of key data elements and quantified parameters in structured reports (“radiomics”) permits automatic functions (e.g. TNM staging), potential integration with other clinical parameters (e.g. laboratory results), data sharing (e.g. registries, biobanks) and data mining for research, teaching and other purposes. This article outlines the requirements for a successful structured reporting strategy (definition of content and structure, standard terminologies, tools and protocols). A potential implementation strategy is outlined. Moving from conventional prose reports to structured reporting is endorsed as a positive development, and must be an international effort, with international design and adoption of structured reporting templates that can be translated and adapted in local environments as needed. Industry involvement is key to success, based on international data standards and guidelines. Key Points: • Standardisation of radiology report structure ensures completeness and comparability of reports. • Use of standardised language in reports minimises ambiguity. • Structured reporting facilitates automatic functions, integration with other clinical parameters and data sharing. • International and inter-society cooperation is key to developing successful structured report templates. • Integration with industry providers of radiology-reporting software is also crucial. © 2018, The Author(s).","Automation D001331; Communication D003142; Radiology standards Q000592; Radiology statistics & numerical data Q000706; Radiology trends Q000639","","Review","Scopus"

This paper explains the necessary data preprocessing steps, reviews the main methods for automated labelling and compares their performance. There are four main methods of automated labelling, namely: (1) rules-based text-matching algorithms, (2) conventional machine learning models, (3) neural network models and (4) Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) models. Rules-based labellers perform a brute force search against manually curated keywords and are able to achieve high F1 scores. However, they require proper handling of negative words. Machine learning models require preprocessing that involves tokenization and vectorization of text into numerical vectors. Multilabel classification approaches are required in labelling radiology reports and conventional models can achieve good performance if they have large enough training sets. Deep learning models make use of connected neural networks, often a long short-term memory network, and are similarly able to achieve good performance if trained on a large data set. BERT is a transformer-based model that utilizes attention. Pretrained BERT models only require fine-tuning with small data sets. In particular, domain-specific BERT models can achieve superior performance compared with the other methods for automated labelling. © 2023 The Authors.

Statistical analysis determined the percentages and frequencies for the clinical site, frequency and pattern of patient portal use, as well as statistical differences. Results: A total of 31 (response rate = 28%, 31/108) at least partially completed surveys were received.

Inevitably, this involves a judgement opinion from the reviewing radiologist. Peer feedback is the means by which any form of peer review is communicated back to the original author of the report. This article defines terms, discusses the current status, identifies problems, and provides some recommendations as to the way forward, concentrating upon the software requirements for efficient peer review and peer feedback of reported imaging studies. Radiologists undertake routine peer review in their everyday clinical practice, particularly when reporting and preparing for multidisciplinary team meetings. More formal peer review of reported imaging studies has been advocated as a quality assurance measure to promote good clinical practice. It is also a way of assessing the competency of reporting radiologists referred for investigation to bodies such as the General Medical Council (GMC). The literature shows, firstly, that there is a very wide reported range of discrepancy rates in many studies, which have used a variety of non-comparable methodologies; and secondly, that applying scoring systems in formal peer review is often meaningless, unhelpful, and can even be detrimental. There is currently a lack of electronic peer feedback system software on the market to inform radiologists of any review of their work that has occurred or to provide them with clinical outcome information on cases they have previously reported. Learning opportunities are therefore missed. Radiologists should actively engage with the medical informatics industry to design optimal peer review and feedback software with features to meet their needs. Such a system should be easy to use, be fully integrated with the radiological information and picture archiving systems used clinically, and contain a free-text comment box, without a numerical scoring system. It should form a temporary record that cannot be permanently archived. It must provide automated feedback to the original author. Peer feedback, as part of everyday reporting, should enhance daily learning for radiologists. Software requirements for everyday peer feedback differ from those needed for a formal peer review process, which might only be necessary in the setting of a formal GMC enquiry into a particular radiologist's reporting competence, for example. © 2015 The Royal College of Radiologists.

Objectives: This study aims to provide a systematic review of Deep Learning (DL) approaches to ARRG. Specifically, it aims to answer the following research questions. What data have been used to train and evaluate DL approaches to ARRG? How are DL approaches to ARRG evaluated? How is DL used to generate the reports from radiology images?

We compared DL approaches with respect to the underlying neural network architecture, the method of text generation, problem representation, training strategy, interpretability, and intermediate processing. Discussion and conclusion: Data imbalance (normal versus abnormal cases) and the inner complexity of reports pose major difficulties in ARRG. More appropriate evaluation metrics are required as well as datasets on a much larger scale. Leveraging structured representation of radiology reports and pre-trained language models warrant further research. © 2023","Deep learning; Image processing; Natural language generation; Natural language processing; Neural network","controlled study; deep learning; human; image processing; Medline; natural language processing; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; qualitative analysis; radiology; review; systematic review; Web of Science","Review","Scopus"

The treatment and management of patients relies on accurate and timely imaging diagnosis. However, errors in radiological reports can negatively impact on patient health outcomes. These misdiagnoses can be caused by several different errors, but cognitive biases account for 74 % of all image interpretation errors. There are many biases that can impact on a radiologist's perception and cognitive processes. Several recent narrative reviews have discussed these cognitive biases and have offered possible strategies to mitigate their effects. However, these strategies remain untested. Therefore, the purpose of this scoping review is to evaluate the current knowledge on the extent that cognitive biases impact on medical image interpretation. Material and methods: Scopus and Medline Databases were searched using relevant keywords to identify papers published between 2012 and 2022. A subsequent hand search of the narrative reviews was also performed. All studies collected were screened and assessed against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: Twenty-four publications were included and categorised into five main themes: satisfaction of search, availability bias, hindsight bias, framing bias and other biases. From these studies, there were mixed results regarding the impact of cognitive biases, highlighting the need for further investigation in this area. Moreover, the limited and untested debiasing methods offered by a minority of the publications and narrative reviews also suggests the need for further research. The potential of role of artificial intelligence is also highlighted to further assist radiologists in identifying and mitigating these cognitive biases. Conclusion: Cognitive biases can impact radiologists’ image interpretation, however the effectiveness of debiasing strategies remain largely untested. © 2023 The Authors","Cognitive bias; Error; Heuristics; Interpretation; Radiology","Artificial Intelligence; Bias; Cognition; Diagnostic Imaging; Humans; Radiologists; artificial intelligence; availability bias; cognition; diagnostic error; framing bias; heuristics; hindsight bias; human; human experiment; Medline; narrative; perception; radiologist; radiology; review; satisfaction; Scopus; systematic review; artificial intelligence; cognition; diagnostic imaging; radiologist; statistical bias","Review","Scopus"

Although radiology reports are stored for communication and documentation of diagnostic imaging, harnessing their potential requires efficient and automated information extraction: they exist mainly as free-text clinical narrative, from which it is a major challenge to obtain structured data. Natural language processing (NLP) provides techniques that aid the conversion of text into a structured representation, and thus enables computers to derive meaning from human (ie, natural language) input. Used on radiology reports, NLP techniques enable automatic identification and extraction of information. By exploring the various purposes for their use, this review examines how radiology benefits from NLP. A systematic literature search identified 67 relevant publications describing NLP methods that support practical applications in radiology. This review takes a close look at the individual studies in terms of tasks (ie, the extracted information), the NLP methodology and tools used, and their application purpose and performance results. Additionally, limitations, future challenges, and requirements for advancing NLP in radiology will be discussed. © 2015 RSNA.","","Electronic Health Records; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Natural Language Processing; Radiology; Radiology Information Systems; automation; clinical decision support system; clinical practice; cohort analysis; data analysis; data extraction; electronic health record; human; medical research; medical service; natural language processing; outcome assessment; priority journal; quality control; radiology; Review; systematic review; information retrieval; radiology information system","Review","Scopus"

One of the main described uses of NLP in radiology is cohort building for epidemiological studies. This study aims to assess the accuracy of NLP in identifying a group of patients positive for ureteric stones on Computed Tomography – Kidneys, Ureter, Bladder (CT KUB) reports. Methods: Retrospective review of all CT KUB reports in a single calendar year. A locally available NLP tool was used to automatically classify the reports based on positivity for ureteric stones. This was validated by manual review and refined to maximize the accuracy of stone detection. Results: A total of 1874 CT KUB reports were identified. Manual classification of ureteric stone positivity was 36% compared with 27% using NLP. The accuracy of NLP was 85% with a sensitivity of 66% and specificity of 95%. Incorrect classification was due to misspellings, variable syntax, terminology, pluralization and the inability to exclude clinical request details from the search algorithm. Conclusions: Our NLP tool demonstrated high specificity but low sensitivity at identifying CT KUB reports that are positive for ureteric stones. This was attributable to the lack of feature extraction tools tailored for analysing radiology text, incompleteness of the medical lexicon database and heterogeneity of unstructured reports.

At the same time, an evolution has been occurring in a fundamental component of radiology practice – the radiologist's report. Initially, the radiology report was a private written communication between the radiologist and the referring physician 1,2. Today, the report is an electronic document, displayed on web portals, and visible to both physicians and the patients themselves.3 A provision in the 21st Century Cures Act, signed into law on December 13, 2016, ensures that radiology reports in the electronic health record are visible to patients without delay 4. To meet modern patient expectations and legal requirements, the structure and purpose of the radiologist report is changing.

For purposes of quality assurance in modern radiology a systematic monitoring and analysis of dose related data from radiological examinations is mandatory. Various ways of collecting dose data are available today, for example the Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine - Structured Report (DICOM-SR), optical character recognition and DICOM-modality performed procedure steps (MPPS). The DICOM-SR is part of the DICOM-standard and provides the DICOM-Radiation Dose Structured Report, which is an easily applicable and comprehensive solution to collect radiation dose parameters. This standard simplifies the process of data collection and enables comprehensive dose monitoring. Various commercial dose monitoring software devices with varying characteristics are available today. In this article, we discuss legal obligations, various ways to monitor dose data, current dose monitoring software solutions and future perspectives in regard to the EU Council Directive 2013/59/EURATOM. Key Points: • Automated, systematic dose monitoring is an important element in quality assurance of radiology departments. • DICOM-RDSR-capable CT scanners facilitate the monitoring of dose data. • A variety of commercial and non-commercial dose monitoring software tools are available today. • Successful dose monitoring requires comprehensive infrastructure for monitoring, analysing and optimizing radiation exposure.

AI has potential benefits spanning all steps of the imaging chain, from the prescription of diagnostic tests to the communication of test reports. The use of AI in the field of radiology also poses challenges in doctor–patient communication at the time of the diagnosis. This systematic review focuses on the patient role and the interpersonal skills between patients and physicians when AI is implemented in cancer diagnosis communication. Methods: A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, Medline, Scopus, and PsycNet from 1990 to 2021. The search terms were: (“artificial intelligence” or “intelligence machine”) and “communication” “radiology” and “oncology diagnosis”. The PRISMA guidelines were followed. Results: 517 records were identified, and 5 papers met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Most of the articles emphasized the success of the technological support of AI in radiology at the expense of patient trust in AI and patient-centered communication in cancer disease. Practical implications and future guidelines were discussed according to the results. Conclusions: AI has proven to be beneficial in helping clinicians with diagnosis. Future research may improve patients’ trust through adequate information about the advantageous use of AI and an increase in medical compliance with adequate training on doctor–patient diagnosis communication. © 2023 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; communication; decision-making; patient empowerment","artificial intelligence; breast cancer; cancer diagnosis; cancer screening; cultural factor; doctor patient relationship; Dutchman; human; Internet; Likert scale; mammography; population research; practice guideline; psychological aspect; qualitative research; Review; sample size; semi structured interview; systematic review","Review","Scopus"

We focused on six categories of applications in radiology: medical image segmentation, registration, computer aided detection and diagnosis, brain function or activity analysis and neurological disease diagnosis from fMR images, content-based image retrieval systems for CT or MRI images, and text analysis of radiology reports using natural language processing (NLP) and natural language understanding (NLU). This survey shows that machine learning plays a key role in many radiology applications. Machine learning identifies complex patterns automatically and helps radiologists make intelligent decisions on radiology data such as conventional radiographs, CT, MRI, and PET images and radiology reports. In many applications, the performance of machine learning-based automatic detection and diagnosis systems has shown to be comparable to that of a well-trained and experienced radiologist. Technology development in machine learning and radiology will benefit from each other in the long run. Key contributions and common characteristics of machine learning techniques in radiology are discussed. We also discuss the problem of translating machine learning applications to the radiology clinical setting, including advantages and potential barriers. © 2012 .","Computer-aided detection and diagnosis; Image segmentation; Machine learning; Radiology; Survey","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Subtraction Technique; Computational linguistics; Computer aided analysis; Diagnosis; Image segmentation; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Medical image processing; Natural language processing systems; Radiation; Surveys; Activity analysis; Automatic Detection; Brain functions; Clinical settings; Complex pattern; Computer-aided detection and diagnosis; Content-based image retrieval system; Intelligent decisions; Machine learning applications; Machine learning techniques; Medical image segmentation; MRI Image; NAtural language processing; Natural language understanding; Neurological disease; PET images; Potential barriers; Radiology reports; Technology development; Text analysis; artificial neural network; brain function; clinical decision making; clinical practice; cluster analysis; computer assisted diagnosis; computer assisted tomography; electroencephalogram; functional magnetic resonance imaging; health care survey; image processing; image registration; image segmentation; kernel method; language processing; learning algorithm; machine learning; natural language processing; neurologic disease; positron emission tomography; priority journal; probability; radiography; radiologist; radiology; receiver operating characteristic; reinforcement; review; statistical analysis; statistical model; training; Radiology","Review","Scopus"

Methods: The search was conducted for relevant papers published from January 1992 to October 2013 Comparative studies reporting any of the following outcomes were selected: error rates, departmental productivity, and radiologist productivity. The retrieved studies were assessed for quality and risk of bias. Results: The literature search identified 85 potentially relevant publications, but, based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, only 20 were included. Most studies were before and after assessments with no control group. There was a large amount of heterogeneity due to differences in the imaging modalities assessed and the outcomes measured. The percentage of reports containing at least one error varied from 4.8% to 89% for speech recognition, and from 2.1% to 22% for transcription. Departmental productivity was improved with decreases in report turnaround times varying from 35% to 99%. Most studies found a lengthening of radiologist dictation time. Conclusion: Overall gains in departmental productivity were high, but radiologist productivity, as measured by the time to produce a report, was diminished. © 2015, SAGE Publications Inc.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was approved by the Human Research Committee of the institutional review board. Consecutive de-identified radiology reports (n = 1059) comprising results of barium studies (n = 99), computed tomography (n = 107), mammography (n = 90), magnetic resonance imaging (n = 108), nuclear medicine (n = 99), positron emission tomography (n = 106), radiography (n = 212), ultrasonography (n = 131), and vascular procedures (n = 107) were independently analyzed by two radiologists and then with LEXIMER to categorize the reports into FT and F T-0 (containing or not containing clinically important findings) categories and RT and RT-0 (containing or not containing recommendations for subsequent action) categories. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of LEXIMER for placing reports into FT and FT0 and RT and R T0 categories were assessed by using appropriate statistical tests. RESULTS: There was strong interobserver concordance between the two radiologists for placing radiology reports into FT and RT categories (K = 0.9, P < .01). For the LEXIMER program, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values, respectively, were 97.5% (95% confidence interval [Cl]: 96.6%, 98.5%), 98.9% (95% Cl: 97.9%, 99.6%), 94.9% (95% Cl: 93.1%, 96.0%), 97.5% (95% Cl: 96.6%, 98.0%), and 97.7% (95% Cl: 95.8%, 98.8%) for placing radiology reports into FT and FT0 categories and 99.6% (95% Cl: 99.2%, 99.9%), 98.2% (95% Cl: 95.0%, 99.6%), 99.9% (95% Cl: 99.4%, 99.99%), 99.4% (95% Cl: 96.3%, 99.9%), and 99.7% (95% Cl: 98.9%, 99.9%) for placing reports into RT and R TO categories. CONCLUSION: LEXIMER is an accurate automated engine for evaluating the percentage positivity of clinically important findings and rates of recommendation for subsequent action in unstructured radiology reports. © RSNA, 2004.","","Algorithms; Decision Making, Computer-Assisted; False Negative Reactions; False Positive Reactions; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Mammography; Observer Variation; Radiology Information Systems; Radionuclide Imaging; Sensitivity and Specificity; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Ultrasonography; barium; accuracy; algorithm; analysis; classification; computer assisted tomography; computer program; data base; echography; human; information system; lexicon mediated entropy reduction; mammography; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear medicine; positron emission tomography; prediction and forecasting; priority journal; radiography; radiologist; radiology; review; sensitivity and specificity; statistical analysis","Review","Scopus"

However, a considerable body of existing law addressing injury resulting from lost or misplaced radiologic images indicates the strong possibility that liability will be imposed on radiologists should PACS images be lost or misplaced and patient injury results. Risk management in radiology can lessen the likelihood of incurring a medical malpractice lawsuit, maximize the chance for a successful defense if such a suit is filed, and at the same time enhance the quality of patient care. The following risk-management pointers will help radiologists meet all of these objectives when faced with potential liability arising from lost PACS images. Radiologists using PACS in all or part of their practice should develop and implement quality control mechanisms to ensure that all examinations performed are successfully transmitted to the PACS network and interpreted in a timely fashion. Because this may be difficult for an individual radiologist to accomplish in a busy radiology department, dedicated personnel or an effective automated system may be required. A formal mechanism should be created to identify and address all uninterpreted PACS examinations and a formal policy established for all radiologists to follow in promptly interpreting them. In situations in which an entire study or key images are lost, or when images cannot otherwise be interpreted, the referring physician or the patient should be promptly contacted to schedule a repeated study.","","Aneurysm, Dissecting; Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal; Humans; Liability, Legal; Male; Malpractice; Medical Records; Middle Aged; Physician-Patient Relations; Radiology Department, Hospital; Radiology Information Systems; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; adult; case report; diagnostic imaging; health care policy; health care quality; human; information center; law suit; male; malpractice; medical liability; medical record; medicolegal aspect; priority journal; radiology; review; risk management; X ray film; abdominal aorta aneurysm; article; computer assisted tomography; dissecting aneurysm; doctor patient relation; hospital information system; legal aspect; legal liability; malpractice; middle aged; radiography; radiology department; standard","Review","Scopus"

Blockchain could have the potential to increase radiological data value in both clinical and research settings for the patient digital record, radiological reports, privacy control, quantitative image analysis, cybersecurity, radiomics and artificial intelligence. Up-to-date experiences using blockchain in radiology are still limited, but radiologists should be aware of the emergence of this technology and follow its next developments.

This is due to the introduction of large medical text/image datasets. Generating radiology coherent paragraphs that do more than traditional medical image annotation, or single sentence-based description, has been the subject of recent academic attention. This presents a more practical and challenging application and moves towards bridging visual medical features and radiologist text. So far, the most common approach has been to utilize publicly available datasets and develop DL models that integrate convolutional neural networks (CNN) for image analysis alongside recurrent neural networks (RNN) for natural language processing (NLP) and natural language generation (NLG). This is an area of research that we anticipate will grow in the near future. We focus our investigation on the following critical challenges: understanding radiology text/image structures and datasets, applying DL algorithms (mainly CNN and RNN), generating radiology text, and improving existing DL based models and evaluation metrics. Lastly, we include a critical discussion and future research recommendations.

However, communication between onsite and offsite physicians is a time-consuming process that can obstruct work flow and frequently involves no exchange of visual information, which is especially problematic given the importance of radiologic images for diagnosis and treatment. A prototype World Wide Web-based image documentation and reporting system was developed for use in supporting a ""communication loop"" that is based on the concept of a classic ""wet-read"" system. The proposed system represents an attempt to address many of the problems seen in current communication work flows by implementing a well-documented and easily accessible communication loop that is adaptable to different types of imaging study evaluation. Images are displayed in a native (DICOM) Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine format with a Java applet, which allows accurate presentation along with use of various image manipulation tools. The Web-based infrastructure consists of a server that stores imaging studies and reports, with Web browsers that download and install necessary client software on demand. Application logic consists of a set of PHP (hypertext preprocessor) modules that are accessible with an application programming interface. The system may be adapted to any clinician-specialist communication loop, and, because it integrates radiologic standards with Web-based technologies, can more effectively communicate and document imaging data. ©RSNA, 2007.","","Information Dissemination; Information Storage and Retrieval; Internet; Medical Informatics; Pilot Projects; Radiology; Radiology Information Systems; Remote Consultation; User-Computer Interface; computer interface; hospital information system; information dissemination; information retrieval; Internet; medical informatics; methodology; organization and management; pilot study; radiology; review; teleconsultation","Review","Scopus"
